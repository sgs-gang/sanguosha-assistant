This ability provides significant protection and strengthens his defense during attacks. Examples include Zhen Ji.",

Xiao Qiao’s \"Fantasy\" ability can shift damage to Cao Cao, who then draws cards based on the health difference, using his \"Evil Hero\" to gain powerful cards. This strategy allows Cao Cao to build a large hand and use his abilities repeatedly, especially when Xiao Qiao continues to transfer damage from her to him, while leaving enemies vulnerable. Examples include Xiao Qiao.",
      "Random Strike Amplification: Characters with card abilities can help Cao Cao gain powerful cards through controlled damage.

Examples include Yuan Shao.",

Zhu Rong’s \"Giant Elephant\" can recycle Barbarians when Cao Cao plays it after taking damage to put it into his hand via \"Evil Hero.\" The loop between Cao Cao and Zhu Rong can continue as they recycle Barbarians to deal continuous damage until Cao Cao exhausts his health or eliminates opponents. Examples include Zhu Rong.",
      "Card Multiplication: Characters who can use many cards in one action can dramatically increase Cao Cao’s hand size. Xun You’s \"Element of Surprise\" allows him to use all his cards as a single tool card, like Barbarians or Hail of Arrows. When this happens, Cao Cao can use \"Evil Hero\" to collect all of Xun You’s cards, boosting his resources significantly. Examples include Xun You.",
      "Capture Weakness: Da Qiao’s \"Country Scene\" allows her to use Capture with ease, putting Cao Cao in a dangerous position. This is particularly threatening due to his reliance on tool cards. When facing Da Qiao, Cao Cao’s ability to retaliate is significantly reduced, as she can disable his moves. Examples include Da Qiao.",
      "Bypassing \"Evil Hero\": Zhang Chunhua’s \"Unfeeling\" ability is a direct counter to Cao Cao’s \"Evil Hero.\" Since Zhang Chunhua is not considered the source of damage, her ability bypasses Cao Cao’s primary advantage of picking up cards from damage, nullifying his usual strategy. Examples include Zhang Chunhua.",

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Cao Cao is a strategic character who, unfortunately, has become less prominent as more advanced characters were introduced. Although his most effective strategy—using \"Evil Hero\" to capitalize on Hail of Arrows and Barbarians—remains consistent across expansions, it becomes less impactful over time. \"Evil Hero\" is powerful, but it requires careful management. It shines best when other players use area-of-effect cards like Hail of Arrows or Barbarians. However, when playing Cao Cao, it's crucial to be cautious of Capture, as this card can place him at a significant disadvantage."

      "Cao Cao stands out as one of the most powerful demigod characters in Sanguosha. His \"Tribute\" ability is remarkably versatile, providing an opportunity to gather cards from every player, especially in large games. When using Cao Cao, it’s often advantageous to take damage intentionally, such as during a Barbarian or Hail of Arrows attack, to activate \"Tribute.\" It’s also important to keep Negates on hand to defend against Capture, one of his greatest weaknesses. Strategically, even using a Blaze on himself to activate \"Tribute\" can be a valid tactic, provided he has a way to heal afterward. If facing Cao Cao, the best strategy is often to ignore him. Without damage, \"Tribute\" remains inactive, and Cao Cao cannot utilize his full potential. When forced to kill him, focus on eliminating his allies first, then confront Cao Cao when his power has weakened in the late game."

      "Control with Judgment Manipulators:Characters like Sima Yi and Zhang Jiao, who can manipulate judgment outcomes, pair well with Da Qiao. As Da Qiao frequently uses Capture due to \"Country Scene,\" Sima Yi can force her enemies’ judgments to fail, amplifying her disruption.

      "Card Providers:Da Qiao benefits greatly from teammates who can supply her with diamond-suited cards.

In situations where Dian Wei is critically low on health and unlikely to survive until the next turn, consider using \"Assault\" to finish off an enemy, even if it means sacrificing Dian Wei himself.

For example, Jia Xu is immune to five of the six Break cards, three of the five Steal cards, two of the three Capture cards, and all Barbarians, Coerce, Chains, and Starvation cards in the Base Set and Army Expansion. Only Blaze and Hail of Arrows remain viable threats to him. With the addition of the Black Shield, Jia Xu becomes even harder to take down. However, using Jia Xu requires strategic timing, particularly when activating \"Upheaval.\" His abilities make him a powerful force, but his defensive stance requires careful play to maximize his potential."

      "When Sima Yi takes damage, he can use \"Feedback\" to claim one card from the player who dealt the damage, choosing between a hand card or an equipped card.",

      "If several judgment manipulators are in play, their abilities resolve in order, starting with the current player and moving to the right. Each manipulator has the option to use their ability, continuing clockwise until the character seated directly to the left of the current player.",
      "If Sima Yi is on the brink of death, his abilities are suspended. He cannot take a card from the player who dealt the damage to search for a Peach or Wine until he is revived.",
      "Sima Yi cannot take a judgment card that is currently pending using \"Feedback.\""
    ],
    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Judgment Tinkerers: Characters who manipulate judgment cards can form powerful combinations with Sima Yi. When Zhang Jiao forces a judgment card flip, Sima Yi can offer support by providing spade cards if needed. If Zhang Jiao has the Eight Trigrams armor, Sima Yi can guarantee an Escape. The two can swap cards, with Sima Yi enabling Zhang Jiao to change judgments to his advantage, like turning a card into an Escape. However, seating order is crucial. If Sima Yi sits to Zhang Jiao’s immediate right, he can modify judgment last, protecting allies. If Zhang Jiao is positioned at Sima’s right, Sima’s control over judgments diminishes. Zhang Jiao and Sima Yi are notably strong together, but can also be strategic rivals depending on seating. Examples include Zhang Jiao.",
      "Judgment-Based Characters: Characters who rely heavily on judgment cards benefit from Sima Yi’s ability to replace unwanted cards. Zhen Ji, for example, uses her \"River Goddess\" to flip judgments, and Sima Yi can swap red cards with black ones to ensure her ability continues smoothly, giving her a constant supply of cards while controlling outcomes. Examples include Zhen Ji.",
      "Control Characters: Characters who control enemy actions through Capture effects work well with Sima Yi, as he can ensure the failure of their targets’ judgment flips. Da Qiao’s \"Country Scene\" allows her to cast Capture on multiple opponents, and Sima Yi can manipulate the results to help her succeed. If facing her, Sima can shield his team from Capture. Examples include Da Qiao.",
      "Damage Mitigation: Sima Yi’s \"Feedback\" ability struggles against characters whose damage source isn’t directly traceable, as this limits his ability to steal cards. Zhang Chunhua, with her \"Unfeeling\" ability, avoids being a source of damage, rendering Sima’s Feedback useless against her. Examples include Zhang Chunhua.",
      "Multiple Damage Dealers: Characters capable of dealing multiple instances of damage can exploit Sima Yi’s \"per instance\" card-stealing ability, making it more difficult for him to recover multiple cards quickly. Characters like Xu Chu, who can deal two units of damage easily, are particularly effective in this situation. Examples include Xu Chu."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Sima Yi is a highly strategic character, particularly when paired with Zhang Jiao. His \"Feedback\" can effectively deter opponents from targeting him by reminding them of the potential cost of their actions. If you find yourself low on health, prioritize taking hand cards over equipped cards, as they might provide you with crucial resources like an Escape or Peach to keep you alive. Equipment alone won’t save you if you’re dead. When facing Zhang Jiao as an enemy, exercise caution and prioritize eliminating him swiftly and carefully to prevent his interference in judgment tinkering."

      "Flipping Allies:Xu Sheng can aid allies who need to flip their character card as part of their abilities. Characters like Cao Ren, Forest Lu Bu, and SPStar Diao Chan benefit from this.

      "Extending Protection:Xu Sheng can extend the effects of powerful defensive abilities like Fire Zhuge Liang’s \"Heavy Fog.\" By flipping Zhuge Liang after a successful attack, Xu Sheng can delay Zhuge Liang’s next action phase, prolonging the defensive effects of \"Heavy Fog\" and protecting the entire team for a longer period.",
      "High Health Opponents:Xu Sheng is particularly effective against characters with large health pools, such as Dong Zhuo and Hua Xiong.

After flipping an opponent and forcing them to draw cards, these allies can step in to disrupt or destroy the newly drawn cards, keeping the enemy’s hand weak and vulnerable.",
      "Counter to Flipping Defenses:Characters like Cao Pi and Cao Zhi pose challenges for Xu Sheng. Cao Pi’s \"Exile\" allows him to flip a character face up, negating the effect of Xu Sheng’s flip.

      "Additional Damage Sources: These characters can damage Zhang Jiao through non-attack methods, making them effective enemies. Some examples are Yan Liang & Wen Chou, Xun Yu, and Dian Wei.

    "FinalRemarks": [

Keeping a strong hand to bluff rebels into thinking you have Escapes is crucial. When playing as the king, be wary of Huang Zhong and Gan Ning, as their abilities can cripple you. Conversely, if you are a rebel attacking Zhang Jiao, being to his immediate right gives you a strategic advantage since he may think you are his loyalist."

Xiao Qiao can pass damage to Zhou Tai while he is in his \"Refusing Death\" state, resulting in him drawing four cards since he is missing four units of health. This gives him more options to sustain himself in the game while balancing the damage.",
      "Hand Replenishment:Xun Yu’s ability to take damage for the benefit of others makes him an excellent pairing with Zhou Tai. In Zhou Tai’s \"Refusing Death\" state, Xun Yu can transfer damage to himself and refill Zhou Tai’s hand with four cards. This synergy helps Zhou Tai avoid the pitfalls of being cardless while he’s vulnerable.",
      "Lockdown Tactics:Characters like Xu Huang and Da Qiao can lock Zhou Tai down easily in his \"Refusing Death\" state. Xu Huang’s \"Blockade\" and Da Qiao’s \"Country Scene\" abilities make them prime candidates for using Starvation or Capture against Zhou Tai. These abilities prevent Zhou Tai from doing anything during his turn, significantly hampering his survival chances while he is at zero health.",

Though he can be fun to play due to his resilience, Zhou Tai is not among the best characters in the game."

On the other hand, Sima Yi’s \"Devil\" ability could disrupt her judgments if he is an opponent, flipping a red card that could block her abilities. However, Wang Yi’s \"Chastity\" triggers early, giving her an edge by forcing Sima Yi to respond to her judgment, which limits his options.",
      "Support from Healers:Characters like Wu Guotai and Hua Tuo can keep Wang Yi alive at low health, which enables her to continue maximizing \"Secret Plan\".

While this creates synergy if they are on the same team, it can also be risky if they are opponents. Wang Yi may inadvertently provide Cao Zhi with opportunities to trigger his ability, which could backfire on her team.",
      "Countered by Ma Dai:Ma Dai’s \"Sneak Attack\" can be a serious threat to Wang Yi. By reducing her maximum health, he limits the effectiveness of \"Secret Plan\", which relies on the gap between her current and maximum health. If her health is too low, \"Secret Plan\" becomes nearly useless, making her vulnerable in longer battles."

Xiao Qiao’s \"Fantasy\" can redirect damage to Hua Xiong, allowing him to draw cards based on his missing health units. This can give him a large card draw since his health limit is so high. However, Xiao Qiao can also exploit his weakness with her \"Beauty\" ability, turning spade-suited Attacks into heart-suited ones, bypassing his defenses.",

Gathering equipment and avoiding early exposure is key to his success. The design, while thematically tied to Guan Yu's historical battle, might overemphasize this rivalry—making Hua Xiong excessively vulnerable in games with many red-attack characters.
