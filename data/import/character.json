    "NotableCombinations": [
      "\"Armed Consorts\" Combinations:Fa Zheng can use \"Dazzle\" to acquire equipment from another character and give it to Sun Shangxiang, allowing her to activate her ability, \"Armed Consorts.\" In addition, \"Grudge\" synergizes with Sun Shangxiang’s \"Marriage,\" letting her draw a card after healing Fa Zheng.",
      "Medical Combinations:With Hua Tuo, Fa Zheng can give him a heart card and take a black card for use in \"First Aid\" during Hua Tuo’s turn. Hua Tuo can then heal Fa Zheng, allowing him to draw extra cards from \"Grudge,\" making Hua Tuo’s healing abilities essentially free.",
      "Damage Transfer Combinations:Xiao Qiao is another ideal match. She can pass damage to Fa Zheng, forcing the attacker to experience \"Grudge\" while Fa Zheng draws cards. Additionally, Fa Zheng can give Xiao Qiao heart cards to support her \"Fantasy\" ability.",

      "Fa Zheng is a highly versatile and powerful character. His abilities make him a great fit for most roles, and he works well both independently and as part of a team. However, his teammates must be mindful of his abilities—especially \"Grudge\"—to avoid accidentally triggering it. Additionally, enemies can hoard less useful heart cards to mitigate his deterrent. Despite these minor weaknesses, Fa Zheng is an incredibly enjoyable and challenging character to play, offering great strategic depth."

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Fa Zheng, a trusted advisor to Liu Bei, was instrumental in the conquest of Shu. His political cunning and strategic acumen made him indispensable, and he often advocated for ruthless strategies to secure victories. One of his most famous contributions was advising Liu Bei to preemptively strike against Liu Zhang, leading to the conquest of Yi Province. Fa Zheng’s ability to draw cards through \"Grudge\" reflects his political leverage, making enemies wary of attacking him without paying a price. His \"Dazzle\" ability mirrors his manipulation of resources, using gifts and persuasion to sway others. This ties closely to his historical role as a tactical mastermind whose guidance often shifted the balance of power in Shu’s favor."

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Guan Yu is a strong choice for beginners due to his straightforward ability, \"Fighting Saint,\" which is easy to use and effective in a variety of situations.

As Guan Yu traveled through the five passes, local lords tried to stop him, forcing him to fight and defeat each one. He demonstrated his unmatched combat skill by defeating these generals in single combat, one after another.

      "Huang Yueying is a formidable character with significant potential, rivaling even Huang Gai. However, her reliance on drawing tool cards can be a limiting factor.

Playing as Huang Yueying requires accepting that you will be a primary target for opponents."

      "Folklore adds more depth to this tale, claiming that Huang Yueying wore veils to hide her supposed unattractiveness. She challenged her suitors by testing their courage to see beyond appearances. When Zhuge Liang met her, he boldly removed her veils, revealing her true beauty and proving the rumors false. This story shows Zhuge Liang’s keen insight and appreciation for Huang Yueying’s intelligence, much like how her talents shine through despite initial perceptions.",
      "Huang Yueying's card abilities, \"Gathering Wisdom\" and \"Wondrous Talent,\" reflect her resourcefulness and intellect. Just as Zhuge Liang recognized her hidden potential, her ability to consistently draw cards mirrors her knack for gathering knowledge and using it to her advantage. Her lack of range restrictions further ties into her reputation as an inventor and strategist, enabling her to influence the battlefield without limitations. Her abilities in Sanguosha showcase her strength in leveraging her wisdom and tools to overcome challenges, just as she did historically and in folklore."

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Huang Zhong is an incredibly powerful offensive character, capable of countering some of the game's most popular defensive heroes, such as Zhen Ji and Zhang Jiao. His \"Strong Bow\" makes him dependable and consistent in his attacks, so securing a weapon with a range of at least three should be a top priority when playing him. When attacking, don’t hesitate to use Wine to deal extra damage, and keep a spare weapon in hand whenever possible. His weapons will often be targeted by enemy abilities like Break, Steal, and Coerce, so having a backup can make a difference."

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Huang Zhong's ability, \"Strong Bow,\" ties directly to his legendary prowess with the bow in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The most famous story of his archery skills comes from his duel with the mighty Guan Yu. After several days of battle, the two warriors fought to a standstill. Guan Yu, admiring Huang Zhong's skills and valor, spared his life on one occasion. However, Huang Zhong was later ordered by his superior to kill Guan Yu. Unable to bring himself to betray the man who had shown him mercy, Huang Zhong feigned two arrows, pretending to shoot. On the third shot, he aimed to demonstrate his skill, shooting an arrow that embedded itself in Guan Yu’s helmet without injuring him.",

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Jiang Wei is a tactician’s general, requiring careful use of \"Instigate\" to force enemies into tough situations. Having armor equipped can make him even more resilient, allowing him to force attacks safely. Choosing the right target for \"Instigate\" is key, especially avoiding situations where you discard equipment that prevents the enemy from attacking you. Likewise, activating \"Follow the Master\" should be prioritized, as the gain of \"Astrology\" can turn the tide of a game, ensuring Jiang Wei’s survival and his team’s advantage."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Jiang Wei was famously Zhuge Liang's protégé, rising from a relatively obscure background to become a leading figure in Shu Han's northern campaigns. Originally born in Wei territory, Jiang Wei served as a mid-level officer under the warlord Xiahou Yuan. His talent, particularly his skill in military strategy, caught the eye of Zhuge Liang during the first northern expedition. While Zhuge Liang was conducting his campaign against Wei, Jiang Wei's tactical acumen and loyalty to his homeland were tested.",
      "The most significant moment came during Zhuge Liang’s first northern expedition, where Jiang Wei was stationed in a minor outpost of Tianshui. Faced with an invading Shu force, Jiang Wei attempted to rally Wei's defenses, but most of his comrades doubted his loyalty due to a scheme by Zhuge Liang and deserted him. Zhuge Liang, seeing Jiang Wei's potential, extended an offer for him to join Shu. Jiang Wei accepted, defecting to Shu Han, where Zhuge Liang began to groom him as his successor in military matters.",
      "Jiang Wei went on to become a loyal follower of Zhuge Liang, accompanying him in the subsequent northern expeditions against Wei. After Zhuge Liang’s death, Jiang Wei took up the mantle of leadership in Shu's northern campaigns. Although his campaigns met with mixed success, Jiang Wei remained committed to his mission of fulfilling Zhuge Liang's dream of subjugating Wei and restoring the Han dynasty.",
      "Jiang Wei’s game abilities, \"Instigate\" and \"Follow the Master,\" reflect his historical role as Zhuge Liang's successor. \"Instigate\" mirrors his tactical brilliance and ability to provoke opponents into action—just as Jiang Wei repeatedly forced Wei into defensive positions with his aggressive campaigns. This ability also reflects the way Jiang Wei often lured Wei generals into making mistakes during skirmishes. \"Follow the Master\" is a clear reference to Jiang Wei’s role as the torchbearer of Zhuge Liang's legacy, adopting both his strategies and his astrological planning methods, represented in-game by Jiang Wei gaining \"Astrology\" upon awakening. The moment Jiang Wei sacrifices health to gain this ability is symbolic of his deep commitment to his master’s vision, even at great personal cost."

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Liu Shan, the son of the famed Liu Bei, became the second emperor of Shu Han following his father’s death. His reign is often characterized as weak and ineffective, heavily dependent on the leadership of Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang was instrumental in holding the kingdom together, leading military campaigns and managing internal affairs. Liu Shan was not known for his own political or military skill, and after Zhuge Liang's death, Shu Han’s decline accelerated. In fact, many historical records portray Liu Shan as a ruler content with a life of luxury, disconnected from the needs of his kingdom.",
      "The card ability \"Pleasure\" reflects this aspect of Liu Shan’s historical image. As he indulges in comforts and lets his capable allies bear the burden, \"Pleasure\" symbolizes his passive approach to leadership, where he is protected by his allies’ efforts. \"Decentralization\" mirrors his reliance on others, as Liu Shan allows more competent characters to take control, much like Zhuge Liang effectively led Shu while Liu Shan served as a mere figurehead.",
      "Shu’s geography also played a role in its relative stability during Liu Shan’s reign. The kingdom was well-fortified, surrounded by natural barriers such as mountains and rivers, which helped shield it from direct invasions. This defensive positioning is indirectly tied to \"Seem Foolish,\" as Liu Shan’s ability to recover when at his weakest reflects how Shu’s natural defenses prolonged its survival despite internal decay.",

Similarly, Zhuge Liang, if positioned right before Ma Chao's turn, can use his \"Astrology\" to arrange the deck and guarantee that a red card is ready on top for Ma Chao to flip.",
      "Zhang Jiao's Escape Route:While Ma Chao's \"Iron Cavalry\" can potentially bypass Zhang Jiao's defenses, Zhang Jiao can still be a tricky opponent.

      "Card Destruction Specialists:Characters such as Gan Ning, Zhang Liao, Zhang He, and Xu Huang specialize in destroying hand cards, making it difficult for Ma Su to activate \"Winning Hearts.\" By consistently removing cards from Ma Su’s hand, they can prevent him from maintaining a hand size large enough to use his ability.",
      "Characters Who Discard Cards:Yuan Shu is well-suited to deal with Ma Su's \"Bottomless Tears\" because his \"Trite Rule\" often forces him to discard all his remaining cards at the end of his turn. Similarly, Lu Xun and Sun Shangxiang can capitalize on losing all their cards. Lu Xun’s \"Linked Camps\" activates when he discards all his cards, and Sun Shangxiang draws two cards for each piece of equipment she discards, making them less vulnerable to the effects of \"Bottomless Tears.\"",

      "In the game, Ma Su’s abilities reflect both his potential and his downfall. \"Winning Hearts\" represents his intellectual talent and ability to think strategically, while \"Bottomless Tears\" captures the tragic consequence of his fatal mistake at Jieting, where his failure caused irreparable damage to Shu and his life was forfeit in the aftermath."

Each time Meng Huo was released, he returned with renewed determination, only to be captured again. After the seventh capture, Meng Huo finally surrendered, acknowledging Zhuge Liang’s superior wisdom and strategy. This act of repeated mercy solidified Zhuge Liang’s reputation as a wise and benevolent leader. In Sanguosha, Meng Huo’s ability to recover health with \"Resurgence\" represents this repeated resurgence after every defeat. His enforced role as the source of \"Culprit\" damage reflects the consequences he faced for the rebellions, placing him at the heart of each event, much like his leadership during the southern conflict."

Cao Cao, impressed with Pang Tong’s reputation, invited him to inspect his naval forces. Pang Tong noted that while the strategy was excellent, the instability of the northern troops on the water due to seasickness posed a problem.",

    "Strengths": [
      "Zhang Fei can do a lot of damage in a short amount of time."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Zhang Fei is typically most effective during his first turn. He can easily focus on a single enemy and use all the Attacks in his hand to deal significant damage. However, this leaves him drained of Attacks, making it difficult to respond defensively to Duels and Barbarians later.",
      "While Zhang Fei could choose to save some Attacks for later, this strategy is unreliable. Opponents can gain armor, +1 Horses, or use Capture, preventing Zhang Fei from attacking effectively. It's often best for him to 'strike while the iron is hot.'"
    ],
    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Card Replenishers: Liu Bei, Guo Jia, and Xun Yu are highly beneficial to Zhang Fei, as they can help replenish his hand, allowing him to continue attacking multiple times in a turn.",
      "Escape Artists: Zhen Ji can use any black card as Escape, giving her a strong chance to avoid Zhang Fei's relentless attacks and mitigate his offensive pressure.",
      "Damage Limiters: Chen Gong only receives one unit of damage per turn, effectively neutralizing Zhang Fei's advantage of being able to attack multiple times in a single turn.",
      "Retaliators: Xiahou Dun, Sima Yi, and Fa Zheng possess retaliatory abilities that trigger per attack. Zhang Fei’s multi-attack strategy can lead to repeated activations of these abilities, leaving him vulnerable with fewer cards, reduced health, or both after a prolonged offensive."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "The saying 'the candle that burns twice as bright only lasts half as long' perfectly encapsulates Zhang Fei's approach. His strength lies in delivering a high-impact offensive quickly, but this comes at the cost of his longevity. While it's possible to save attacks for later, Zhang Fei's effectiveness is often maximized by capitalizing on an opponent's vulnerability and going all-in. Like using a Crossbow for a single decisive attack, Zhang Fei's talent is to focus on a weak enemy and strike with everything he has, aiming to finish them off swiftly."

      "One of the most notable episodes in Zhang Fei’s life is his courageous stand at the Changban Bridge. As Cao Cao's massive army pursued Liu Bei's fleeing forces, Zhang Fei made a daring decision to hold them off. He stationed himself alone at the narrow Changban Bridge and, with a fearsome roar that echoed through the mountains, managed to delay Cao Cao's advance. His roar, combined with his fierce demeanor and the sight of his single-handed defense, instilled fear and confusion among Cao Cao’s troops. The psychological impact was so great that Cao Cao’s soldiers hesitated, giving Liu Bei and his followers critical time to escape and regroup."

At great personal risk, Zhao Yun fought his way through enemy ranks, using his exceptional skill and quick thinking to cut down numerous enemies. He returned safely with the child in his arms, cementing his legacy as one of the bravest and most loyal generals of the Three Kingdoms era.",
      "In Sanguosha, Zhao Yun's ability to use Attacks and Escapes interchangeably mirrors his calm and flexible approach on the battlefield. Just as he adapted in the chaos of battle to protect Liu Shan, this ability gives players the means to adapt and survive even when the odds are stacked against them. While his historical feats showed his capacity for daring, the game version is more focused on survival than offense, representing how Zhao Yun often focused on protecting others and himself during critical moments."

While her powers may not always guarantee victory, Zhu Rong is a strong character when played correctly. Her defensive power keeps her in the game, while her offensive potential can overwhelm enemies."

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Zhu Rong, wife of Meng Huo, is one of the most notable female figures from Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Chinese history, remembered for her bravery and martial prowess. She was the daughter of the Fire God and was said to be highly skilled in combat, known for riding into battle, a rarity for women of that era. As a key figure during Zhuge Liang’s Southern Campaign against the Nanman, Zhu Rong fought alongside her husband, Meng Huo, as they resisted the Shu forces.",
      "Zhu Rong was one of the few women documented to have actively led troops in combat. She wielded a spear and rode a warhorse into battle, challenging Shu generals and even personally fighting against renowned warriors. Her courage and skill in combat made her a fearsome leader, one whose loyalty and fierce dedication to her husband were widely respected. Despite her abilities, Zhuge Liang’s strategic brilliance outmatched the southern forces, and both Zhu Rong and Meng Huo were captured multiple times by Zhuge Liang’s army. After the seventh release, both Zhu Rong and Meng Huo finally acknowledged Zhuge Liang's wisdom and superiority, leading to their surrender and lasting peace between the Nanman tribes and Shu.",
      "This story ties directly into Zhu Rong's abilities in Sanguosha. Her \"Giant Elephant\" skill, which makes her immune to the Barbarians tool card, reflects her heritagee as the ruler of the Nanman. Meanwhile, \"Intense Edge\", allowing her to strip away an opponent's cards after damaging them, mirrors her ferocity in battle, where she would disarm and defeat foes with her skill. Much like in history, Zhu Rong’s presence on the battlefield in the game is formidable, and her ability to capture her enemies’ resources showcases her power to dominate a fight."

      "Lockout Protection: Chen Gong can protect himself from Guan Xing and Zhang Bao’s multiple attacks by preventing damage through his ability, creating a defensive wall."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Guan Xing and Zhang Bao are an exciting and powerful duo, but their ability lacks originality, as it directly copies the abilities of their fathers. Despite this, they remain a fun choice to play, especially when the timing is right for a big attack. It is crucial to activate \"Paternal Souls\" when ready to unleash multiple attacks, but if the ability fails early in the game, it is often better to remain patient rather than reveal your hand too soon. Accept that you may only be able to use \"Paternal Souls\" once in a game, similar to Huang Gai's aggressive but limited approach."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Guan Xing and Zhang Bao were prominent figures in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, each carrying the legacy of their famous fathers, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. Just before the Battle of Yiling, the two sons initially compete for leadership of the vanguard force. However, Liu Bei intervenes and binds them as oath brothers, mirroring the famous oath their fathers made years earlier. This event marks the beginning of their deep bond and shared loyalty to the Shu cause.",
      "Guan Xing’s most notable achievement in the novel comes when he avenges his father by slaying Pan Zhang, the general who had captured Guan Yu. He then retrieves his father’s legendary weapon, the Green Dragon Blade. Later, Guan Xing continues his service under Zhuge Liang, leading Shu forces in the Northern Expeditions against Wei until his death from illness.",
      "Zhang Bao similarly plays a significant role in Shu’s military campaigns. He fights alongside Guan Xing, including during Zhuge Liang’s Northern Expeditions. Tragically, Zhang Bao meets an early demise in the third Northern Expedition when he falls into a gully while pursuing Wei generals and succumbs to his injuries. His death is so devastating that Zhuge Liang, upon hearing the news, faints from grief.",
      "In Sanguosha, their shared ability \"Paternal Souls\" reflects their connection to their fathers' martial prowess, with Guan Xing’s \"Fighting Saint\" channeling Guan Yu’s precision and Zhang Bao’s \"Roar\" embodying Zhang Fei’s fierce attacks. Their bond in the game mirrors their relationship in the novel, where they grow from rivals to sworn brothers, united in their quest to honor their fathers' legacies."

    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Liao Hua was a notable figure in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, recognized for his endurance and loyalty to Shu.

When Guan Yu was captured and executed by Sun Quan's forces, Liao Hua managed to escape and later joined Liu Bei, becoming a steadfast servant of Shu.",
      "Throughout his career, Liao Hua was known for his resilience, often surviving difficult situations where others perished. In the novel, he repeatedly escapes death, which aligns with his Sanguosha ability \"Aspiration.\" Despite his long life, Liao Hua never achieved the fame of his more celebrated peers, but his dedication to Shu was unwavering. He served Zhuge Liang faithfully during the Northern Expeditions and continued to support Shu after Zhuge Liang's death, eventually rising to high military ranks. His character is emblematic of perseverance, outlasting many of his contemporaries and being one of the few who witnessed the full rise and fall of Shu.",

      "Ma Dai is a powerful and strategic character. His ability to reduce maximum health makes him particularly threatening, especially in longer games where health management is key. To maximize his effectiveness, focus on one enemy at a time and aim to lower their health incrementally. Equipping a -1 horse increases his threat range significantly, making it easier to target enemies. While \"Sneak Attack\" is potent, it’s important to know when to use it, as it can bypass damage-triggered abilities or fall short when direct damage is preferable. Be mindful of defensive characters and enemies with abilities that rely on taking damage. Ma Dai is especially effective in disrupting characters with awakened abilities, though keeping track of their ability progress may require extra attention."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Ma Dai is best remembered for his loyalty to the Shu Han state and his service under Zhuge Liang. A relative of the famed Ma Chao, Ma Dai continued to serve after Ma Chao’s death, proving himself in battle. His most famous accomplishment came after Zhuge Liang’s death during the Northern Expeditions against Wei. When Zhuge Liang passed away, Wei Yan, another Shu general, rebelled, attempting to continue the fight despite the retreat orders. Furious at being sidelined, Wei Yan destroyed the gallery roads to block Shu forces from returning, accusing Yang Yi of treason and leading his men to attack. However, Wei Yan’s own troops abandoned him after Wang Ping denounced his actions, leaving him isolated.",
      "Ma Dai had been secretly ordered by Zhuge Liang to act if Wei Yan rebelled, with instructions to follow him, but kill whoever uttered a specific phrase. During the rebellion, a governor was commanded to surrender to anyone, including Wei Yan, if they declared, \"Who dares to kill me?\" When Wei Yan shouted this phrase three times, Ma Dai immediately executed him, ending the mutiny and bringing Wei Yan’s head to Yang Yi. This decisive action prevented further conflict and protected Shu from internal strife, solidifying Ma Dai’s reputation as a loyal and reliable general.",
      "In Sanguosha, Ma Dai’s \"Sneak Attack\" reflects his ability to eliminate threats in a decisive manner, much like his role in cutting down Wei Yan before further rebellion could take hold. His \"Horsemanship\" ability also ties into his reputation for battlefield mobility, enabling him to pursue and swiftly strike down enemies. By reducing his enemies' maximum health, Ma Dai cripples them strategically, just as he ended the threat of Wei Yan when it mattered most."

His reliance on red cards makes it essential to manage his hand effectively, but when played well, Wang Ping is a valuable asset in any role."

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Wang Ping, courtesy name Zijun, played a significant role during the Three Kingdoms period, and his career reflects his strategic insight and dedication. Originally serving under Cao Cao, Wang Ping defected to Liu Bei's forces during the Hanzhong Campaign. Despite being illiterate, he demonstrated strong military acumen and earned Zhuge Liang's trust, steadily rising to prominent ranks within Shu.",
      "Wang Ping's character is enhanced with dramatic moments, particularly during his fictionalized role in Wei's Hanzhong Campaign. There, he opposes Xu Huang’s risky tactic of crossing the Han River, warning that such a maneuver would make retreat impossible and leave the army vulnerable. His foresight, ignored by Xu Huang, results in a defeat for the Wei army. After Xu Huang’s failure, Wang Ping famously says, \"I warned you, but you did not listen,\" and he soon defects to Liu Bei’s side. This sequence illustrates Wang Ping’s keen strategic thinking and his loyalty to his commanders, which becomes a key trait in his portrayal.",
      "Another pivotal moment in Romance of the Three Kingdoms involves Wang Ping at the end of Zhuge Liang's life. Zhuge Liang names Wang Ping, along with Liao Hua, Ma Dai, Zhang Ni, and Zhang Yi, as one of the five loyal generals tasked with safeguarding Shu. This honor cements his legacy in the novel as one of Shu’s most reliable and steadfast figures.",
      "Historically, Wang Ping’s actions at the Battle of Jieting, where he managed to salvage a dire situation after Ma Su's blunder, and his leadership during the Battle of Xingshi, where he successfully defended against Cao Shuang’s forces, further highlight his military prowess. His portrayal in both history and the novel emphasizes his loyalty, strategic thinking, and dedication to Shu’s cause, making him a respected figure in both narratives."

Despite the scarcity of historical details, his loyalty to his father has cemented his place in the historical narrative.",

After being impressed by Guan Ping’s bravery and potential, Guan Yu adopts him, and the two fight side by side in many battles. Guan Ping plays a critical role during the Battle of Runan, where he leads troops to rescue Liu Bei from an attack by Zhang He. Later, he joins Guan Yu in defending Jing Province and participates in the Battle of Fancheng, where they famously flood seven of Cao Cao’s armies. Despite these victories, Sun Quan’s betrayal leads to Guan Ping and Guan Yu’s capture at Maicheng. When offered a chance to surrender, both refuse and are executed.",

Jian Yong’s wit and persuasive skills were legendary, as demonstrated in a famous story where he used humor to convince Liu Bei to pardon families wrongfully accused of breaking a ban on alcohol brewing. Jian Yong's carefree nature is reflected in his ability to ignore formalities, a characteristic that plays into his card abilities in Sanguosha.

Guan Yu’s defeat and execution by Sun Quan’s forces led to Liu Bei resenting Liu Feng for not providing reinforcements. This, along with Meng Da’s defection to Wei, led to Liu Feng’s downfall.

Before taking his own life, Liu Feng expressed regret for not heeding Meng Da’s warnings to defect with him.",

The Betrayals in the game tie into the historical betrayal by Meng Da and Liu Feng's inability to assist Guan Yu. This duality—of strength and vulnerability—perfectly captures Liu Feng's character in history."

During the later campaigns of Shu, they were often at the forefront of battles, continuing the fight against Wei and seeking to avenge their fathers' deaths.",
      "In Romance of the Three Kingdoms, both sons are depicted as brave and capable warriors. After the death of their fathers, they swore revenge against the enemies of Shu, particularly Cao Wei. Guan Xing was known for his intelligence and courage, while Zhang Bao inherited his father’s immense strength and ferocity. Together, they were among Zhuge Liang's most trusted generals during his northern expeditions.",
      "Their ability, \"Paternal Souls,\" is a tribute to their lineage, drawing on the powers of Guan Yu's \"Fighting Saint\" and Zhang Fei's \"Roar.\" These abilities reflect the qualities they inherited from their fathers—Guan Yu's discipline and precision with his red cards and Zhang Fei's unrelenting aggression in battle. Their history of working together to honor their fathers and protect the kingdom of Shu is mirrored in their game abilities, which focus on coordinated, powerful attacks and capitalizing on their family’s strengths."

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Ma Dai offers a balance of offense and control, though his reliance on judgment flips can limit the consistency of his effectiveness. With the right support and situational awareness, he can be a dangerous opponent capable of locking down key targets. However, his success largely depends on his range and the flipped judgment card's color, which can sometimes be unpredictable.

His extended range from \"Horsemanship\" ties in with his background as a cavalry commander, emphasizing his swift and far-reaching attacks. This combination of aggression and tactical card manipulation reflects Ma Dai’s historical role as a general capable of handling dangerous situations with precision and decisiveness."

    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Card Giving Characters:Characters like Liu Bei or Guo Jia, who can provide Wu Yi with additional cards, greatly enhance his ability to make full use of \"Distant Charge.\" With more cards to play during his turn, Wu Yi can quickly expand his range and target multiple players with ease, maximizing his offensive potential.",
      "Equipment Manipulators:Teammates like Wu Guotai, who specialize in equipment manipulation, can help ensure Wu Yi always has the right tools to take advantage of his abilities. A good combination of weapons, armor, and horses can make Wu Yi nearly unstoppable once he begins building momentum during his turn.",
      "Defensive Powers:Characters like Yu Jin have a defensive power that is not classified as armor. Because of this, he will maintain his defenses even when Yu Yi fully activates \"Distant Charge\". Other characters like Fire Zhuge Liang only have abilities that add armor, which would be lost.",
      "Control and Disruption Specialists:Pairing Wu Yi with characters like Sima Yi or Xiahou Dun, who can control the flow of cards and disrupt Wu Yi during his turn, making it harder for him to gain control of the battlefield.

      "Wu Yi is an aggressive character whose ability to rapidly extend his attack range and negate armor makes him a powerful offensive force. \"Distant Charge\" allows him to bring all players within his reach by simply playing cards, while his ability to target multiple opponents at once gives him excellent crowd control. However, Wu Yi is vulnerable between turns, as his abilities are entirely offensive and do not provide much in the way of defense.

However, Zhang Song secretly wanted to assist Cao Cao in taking control of the province from the weak Liu Zhang.  In another reversal, Cao Cao’s condescending treatment and disregard for Zhang Song left him insulted. In response, Zhang Song returned to Liu Zhang, stopping with Liu Bei as to not return empty handed. ",
      "Zhang Song persuaded Liu Zhang to invite Liu Bei to lead troops into Yi Province. Zhang Song argued that Liu Bei’s support could secure Yi Province against Zhang Lu. When Liu Bei arrived, Zhang Song provided him with crucial information about Yi Province’s geography, resources, and defenses, even going so far as to supply him with a detailed map, revealing a willingness to support Liu Bei over his lord, Liu Zhang. Zhang Song, along with Fa Zheng, further orchestrated a plot to help Liu Bei seize control of the province from Liu Zhang.",

This ability mirrors how he supplied Liu Bei with maps and details of Yi’s defenses, allowing him to adapt his plans based on this intelligence. His second ability, \"Image Offering,\" represents his attempts to influence others by providing resources and assistance—mirroring his early advocacy for Liu Bei and his efforts to support him with troops and supplies, despite personal risk.

    "NotableCombinations": [

      "Aggressive Damage Dealers: Teaming up with characters who also excel in direct attacks like Xu Chu creates a high-pressure offense that overwhelms opponents. The teamwork between Zhou Cang and damage-dealers amplifies the threat level.",

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Zhou Cang’s \"Loyal Bravery\" skill emphasizes both relentless offense and team-oriented resource redistribution. While he can keep the Escapes he gives out, the ability to sustain attacks on a target while supporting allies makes him a versatile character. However, his aggressive style can leave him exposed, making him a challenging character who requires a balance of offense and positioning to maximize his strengths."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Known for his loyalty, Zhou Cang is depicted as a strong warrior, whose path initially diverges from the heroes of Shu before finding his place alongside Guan Yu. Originally, he joins the Yellow Turban Rebellion, where he encounters Guan Yu, whose courage and honor leave a lasting impression on him.",
      "After the rebellion is crushed, Zhou Cang becomes a bandit on Mount Woniu, teaming up with Pei Yuanshao, another former rebel. Fate reunites him with Guan Yu on a mountain road, and, captivated by Guan Yu’s integrity and leadership, Zhou Cang swears loyalty to him. Appointed as Guan Yu's weapon bearer, he also uses his skills to assist in Guan Yu's campaigns, notably during the Battle of Fancheng. During this battle, Zhou Cang helps secure victory by capturing Pang De amid the flood that overwhelms the castle. Tragically, upon hearing of Guan Yu and Guan Ping’s capture and execution by Sun Quan’s forces, Zhou Cang ends his own life out of loyalty.",
      "Zhou Cang’s legacy lives on as a symbol of steadfast loyalty. He is often depicted alongside Guan Yu as a door god in temples, representing devotion and courage. This enduring portrayal captures the spirit of Zhou Cang’s \"Loyal Bravery\" ability in Sanguosha, which emphasizes his commitment to aiding his allies and remaining resilient in battle, true to the unshakable loyalty he showed in life and legend."

He can then unleash significant damage by reusing these cards on his turn.",
      "Cao Cao also excels with Duel. He can 'bully' weaker characters using this card. If Cao Cao takes damage during a duel, he can retrieve the Duel card and immediately use it again. With sufficient health, he can ensure he deals damage to his opponent by reclaiming the card each time he loses the duel.",
      "Cao Cao can be a strong team player as well. Picking up cards that get used allows for some characters to play off each other. For more details, refer to the 'Notable Combinations' section.",
      "\"Escort,\" Cao Cao's king ability, is especially powerful. Wei characters like Zhen Ji or Yu Jin can frequently supply him with Escapes. Additionally, a Wei character equipped with Eight Trigrams can consistently provide Cao Cao with Escapes, enhancing his survivability."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
      "\"Evil Hero\" requires Cao Cao to take damage, which can be a double-edged sword. If he doesn't manage this ability carefully, he may end up with dangerously low health.",
      "Cao Cao is particularly vulnerable to Capture. If he accumulates damage from cards and then falls victim to Capture, he may be forced to discard most, if not all, of the cards he gained, leaving him with minimal health and few resources at the end of his turn.",
      "Additionally, certain characters possess abilities that inflict direct damage, bypassing \"Evil Hero\" entirely. These abilities negate Cao Cao's main advantage, making him more susceptible to being overwhelmed."
    ],
    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Loyalist Synergy: Characters who are loyal to Cao Cao or support his survival make excellent combinations with him, especially Zhen Ji. As a loyalist to King Cao Cao, Zhen Ji’s \"Overturned Country\" lets her use black-suited cards as Escapes, making her a reliable shield for Cao Cao. This ability provides significant protection and strengthens his defense during attacks. Examples include Zhen Ji.",
      "Damage Transference: Characters who can transfer damage to Cao Cao help him generate resources while minimizing harm. Xiao Qiao’s \"Fantasy\" ability can shift damage to Cao Cao, who then draws cards based on the health difference, using his \"Evil Hero\" to gain powerful cards. This strategy allows Cao Cao to build a large hand and use his abilities repeatedly, especially when Xiao Qiao continues to transfer damage from her to him, while leaving enemies vulnerable. Examples include Xiao Qiao.",
      "Random Strike Amplification: Characters with card abilities can help Cao Cao gain powerful cards through controlled damage. Yuan Shao’s \"Random Strike\" can select cards that Cao Cao can turn into Hail of Arrows or other tools, taking voluntary damage to add these cards to his hand with \"Evil Hero,\" amplifying his options. Examples include Yuan Shao.",
      "Barbarians Loop: Characters who cycle cards like Barbarians synergize well with Cao Cao. Zhu Rong’s \"Giant Elephant\" can recycle Barbarians when Cao Cao plays it after taking damage to put it into his hand via \"Evil Hero.\" The loop between Cao Cao and Zhu Rong can continue as they recycle Barbarians to deal continuous damage until Cao Cao exhausts his health or eliminates opponents. Examples include Zhu Rong.",
      "Card Multiplication: Characters who can use many cards in one action can dramatically increase Cao Cao’s hand size. Xun You’s \"Element of Surprise\" allows him to use all his cards as a single tool card, like Barbarians or Hail of Arrows. When this happens, Cao Cao can use \"Evil Hero\" to collect all of Xun You’s cards, boosting his resources significantly. Examples include Xun You.",
      "Capture Weakness: Da Qiao’s \"Country Scene\" allows her to use Capture with ease, putting Cao Cao in a dangerous position. This is particularly threatening due to his reliance on tool cards. When facing Da Qiao, Cao Cao’s ability to retaliate is significantly reduced, as she can disable his moves. Examples include Da Qiao.",
      "Bypassing \"Evil Hero\": Zhang Chunhua’s \"Unfeeling\" ability is a direct counter to Cao Cao’s \"Evil Hero.\" Since Zhang Chunhua is not considered the source of damage, her ability bypasses Cao Cao’s primary advantage of picking up cards from damage, nullifying his usual strategy. Examples include Zhang Chunhua.",
      "Direct Damage Dealers: Characters with direct damaging abilities that bypass the need for cards pose a significant challenge to Cao Cao. When they deal damage directly, Cao Cao cannot use \"Evil Hero\" to pick up cards, leaving him vulnerable. Examples include characters with abilities that deal direct damage."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Cao Cao is a strategic character who, unfortunately, has become less prominent as more advanced characters were introduced. Although his most effective strategy—using \"Evil Hero\" to capitalize on Hail of Arrows and Barbarians—remains consistent across expansions, it becomes less impactful over time. \"Evil Hero\" is powerful, but it requires careful management. It shines best when other players use area-of-effect cards like Hail of Arrows or Barbarians. However, when playing Cao Cao, it's crucial to be cautious of Capture, as this card can place him at a significant disadvantage."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "In Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Cao Cao is known for his cunning and strategic mind, which is reflected in his \"Evil Hero\" ability that allows him to benefit from taking damage. His talent for turning enemies into allies parallels his card’s ability to collect and reuse powerful tools like Barbarians and Hail of Arrows. Historically, this is evident in how Cao Cao gained some of his best generals from defeated opponents, such as Xu Huang, Zhang Liao, and Zhang He. These generals also played key roles in protecting their liege, which is captured in his \"Escort\" ability. A prime example from the novel is when Cao Cao, fleeing from the relentless pursuit of Ma Chao, is saved by Xu Chu, who rescues him and ensures his safe escape."

Upon taking power, Cao Pi quickly moved to eliminate any potential threats to his authority. His brothers were removed from positions of influence and sent away from the capital, ensuring that Cao Pi would not face competition for control. This ruthless consolidation of power reflects his \"Unnatural Death\" and \"Exile\" abilities in Sanguosha, where he capitalizes on the demise of others and controls their actions, much like he did in life to secure his reign over Wei."

Despite being heavily outnumbered, Cao Ren made the strategic decision to hunker down within the city's defenses. He meticulously fortified his position, waiting for an opportune moment to strike back. When Zhou Yu attempted an all-out assault, Cao Ren laid a trap, leading Zhou Yu to suffer a severe injury, halting the attack and allowing Cao Ren to hold the city.",

The most famous account of their rivalry occurred when Cao Zhi, displaced and fearing for his life, was summoned by Cao Pi. In a dramatic test of wit, Cao Pi ordered him to compose a poem in seven steps or face execution. Cao Zhi masterfully crafted a verse on the spot, using beans and bean stalks as metaphors for the brothers—both from the same root yet at odds with each other. The moving poem, known as the Seven Steps Verse, stirred Cao Pi’s emotions, and he chose to spare Cao Zhi's life, though Cao Zhi remained politically sidelined.",
      "This moment ties directly to Cao Zhi's in-game ability \"Fallen Bloom,\" where his poetic genius is a literal life-saving skill. Much like the historical event, Cao Zhi uses his wit to overcome overwhelming odds, reflecting his capacity for quick thinking under pressure.",
      "In addition to his literary talents, Cao Zhi was fond of drinking and frequently indulged in heavy drinking, often to his own detriment. His love for alcohol and poetry became intertwined, and his excessive drinking led him into trouble on several occasions. Cao Cao once reprimanded him for his lack of discipline, warning him that it would tarnish his reputation. This behavior is reflected in the unpredictability of Cao Zhi's other ability, \"Wine Poems.\" Just as his fondness for drink could lead him into both moments of brilliance and trouble, the ability allows him to manipulate red-suited cards, representing the highs and lows of his life choices.",

      "Players familiar with Deng Ai may avoid triggering \"Military Farm,\" weakening him significantly if he cannot activate the ability."
    ],
    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Generals Who Trigger Card Loss: Deng Ai benefits greatly from characters who can force him to lose cards outside of his turn, which enables him to use \"Military Farm.\" Characters like Sun Jian, Sun Ce, and Fa Zheng excel here, as their abilities often involve manipulating card resources, creating opportunities for Deng Ai to accumulate Farms.",
      "Judgment Manipulators: Characters who can influence judgments are powerful allies or threats to Deng Ai. Sima Yi, Zhang Jiao, and Zhuge Liang can alter or manipulate judgments, helping Deng Ai avoid heart flips to ensure his \"Military Farm\" activates more consistently. Conversely, these same abilities can disrupt Deng Ai if used by enemies.",
      "Characters Who Prevent Farm Use: Some characters can negate the power of Deng Ai’s Farms after he activates \"Strategic Pass.\" Lu Xun’s \"Humility\" makes him immune to Steal, while Jia Xu’s \"Curtain\" blocks black-suited tool cards, neutralizing Deng Ai’s ability to use his Farms for stealing.",
      "Characters with Unavoidable Damage: Deng Ai struggles against characters whose abilities deal unavoidable damage, as they bypass his ability to lose cards strategically.

His strategic brilliance came to full display during the final stages of the Three Kingdoms period when he led an audacious campaign into Shu. Faced with an impassable mountain route, Deng Ai led his forces along a treacherous path where many soldiers were lost. However, this daring maneuver allowed him to slip behind enemy lines, advancing deep into Shu territory. His efforts culminated in the capture of Chengdu, where Liu Shan surrendered, marking the fall of Shu.",
      "Deng Ai’s ability to capitalize on weakened defenses mirrors his \"Military Farm\" ability, where he gains power from discarded cards outside of his turn.

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Dian Wei excels in offensive play but struggles defensively. If you enjoy dealing consistent and unavoidable damage, Dian Wei will be a fun character to use. However, it’s essential to use \"Assault\" strategically, as misusing it can quickly lead to Dian Wei’s death. When facing characters with less health than Dian Wei, his ability gives him a significant advantage. However, if his target has more health or is better defended, Dian Wei’s aggressive playstyle may backfire. In situations where Dian Wei is critically low on health and unlikely to survive until the next turn, consider using \"Assault\" to finish off an enemy, even if it means sacrificing Dian Wei himself. This tactic is particularly effective for rebels, as it prevents the king from gaining the three-card bounty upon Dian Wei’s death."

To weaken him, they orchestrated a plot to get Dian Wei intoxicated at a banquet, then stole his weapons while he was defenseless.",
      "When the attack began, despite being unarmed and without armor, Dian Wei awoke and fiercely defended Cao Cao’s tent. He grabbed an infantry sword and single-handedly cut down over twenty enemies, holding off the attack until reinforcements could arrive. Eventually, Dian Wei was overwhelmed by the sheer number of attackers and, after being wounded in multiple places, fought to his last breath. His selfless defense allowed Cao Cao to escape and, in recognition of his sacrifice, Cao Cao instituted posthumous honors for Dian Wei, leading the mourning himself. Dian Wei’s fierce, sacrificial nature is mirrored in his game ability \"Assault\", where he sacrifices his health to damage his opponents, much like how he gave his life to defend Cao Cao."

      "Guo Jia's \"Bestowed Rouse\" is one of the best abilities in the game, benefiting both him and his team.

This gives him a higher chance of drawing a Peach or Wine, saving him from death and enabling him to draw even more cards afterward.",
      "Guo Jia's \"Heaven's Envy\" ability synergizes exceptionally well with the Eight Trigrams armor. If attacked and the judgment card is red, Guo Jia draws a card. If the judgment is black, he still draws a card and might get hurt, allowing him to activate \"Bestowed Rouse\" and draw two more cards. Losing one unit of health to gain three cards is a highly favorable trade for both Guo Jia and his team.",

      "Guo Jia is particularly vulnerable to Capture. If he has taken multiple instances of damage between turns and chooses to keep the cards gained from \"Bestowed Rouse\", being captured can be devastating. When Capture is used against him, his action phase is skipped, and he proceeds directly to his discard phase after drawing cards. This forces Guo Jia to discard all of the extra cards he gained, wasting his potential resources and leaving him significantly weakened."

After taking damage, Guo Jia can use \"Bestowed Rouse\" to give Hua Tuo red cards, enabling \"First Aid\" to heal him.

      "Loyalist with Cao Cao: Guo Jia makes an excellent loyalist, especially under Cao Cao. If equipped with Eight Trigrams, Guo Jia can not only protect Cao Cao but also benefit from keeping the judgment card, further bolstering the team's defense.",
      "Damage Manipulators: Characters like Xiao Qiao, who can redirect damage, pair well with Guo Jia. Xiao Qiao’s \"Fantasy\" lets her pass damage to Guo Jia, causing him to draw cards from both \"Heaven's Envy\" and \"Bestowed Rouse,\" generating many cards for minimal damage.",
      "Captors: Characters who focus on controlling the action phase can exploit Guo Jia’s weaknesses. Da Qiao's \"Country Scene\" is a perfect example. By capturing Guo Jia, she can prevent him from using his cards effectively, as seen in the weaknesses section.",
      "Health Loss Specialists: Guo Jia's abilities are directly countered by characters like Zhang Chunhua. With \"Unfeeling,\" Zhang Chunhua prevents Guo Jia from benefiting from \"Bestowed Rouse\" when losing health, crippling his card-drawing potential and rendering him much less effective."

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Guo Jia is a phenomenal character, arguably one of the best in the base set of generals. His value holds strong even as more expansions are introduced to the game. Guo Jia shines in team situations and remains a formidable contender in one-on-one battles. The key to maximizing his potential lies in strategic use of \"Bestowed Rouse.\" Pay attention to the abilities of your teammates and distribute cards that will enhance their powers. However, be cautious of Capture, which can cripple his card advantage, and avoid becoming overconfident with \"Bestowed Rouse.\""

      "Guo Jia was a brilliant strategist for Cao Cao, and his advice was often instrumental in Cao Cao's military victories.

He advised Cao Cao to let Yuan Shao’s remaining sons fight amongst themselves, predicting their internal strife would weaken their position. Tragically, Guo Jia died from illness before the plan reached its fruition. His death was a significant loss for Cao Cao, who later lamented that, had Guo Jia lived, the campaign would have been resolved much sooner.",

If Sima Yi sits to Zhang Jiao’s immediate right, he can modify judgment last, protecting allies. If Zhang Jiao is positioned at Sima’s right, Sima’s control over judgments diminishes. Zhang Jiao and Sima Yi are notably strong together, but can also be strategic rivals depending on seating. Examples include Zhang Jiao.",
      "Judgment-Based Characters: Characters who rely heavily on judgment cards benefit from Sima Yi’s ability to replace unwanted cards. Zhen Ji, for example, uses her \"River Goddess\" to flip judgments, and Sima Yi can swap red cards with black ones to ensure her ability continues smoothly, giving her a constant supply of cards while controlling outcomes. Examples include Zhen Ji.",
      "Control Characters: Characters who control enemy actions through Capture effects work well with Sima Yi, as he can ensure the failure of their targets’ judgment flips. Da Qiao’s \"Country Scene\" allows her to cast Capture on multiple opponents, and Sima Yi can manipulate the results to help her succeed. If facing her, Sima can shield his team from Capture. Examples include Da Qiao.",
      "Damage Mitigation: Sima Yi’s \"Feedback\" ability struggles against characters whose damage source isn’t directly traceable, as this limits his ability to steal cards. Zhang Chunhua, with her \"Unfeeling\" ability, avoids being a source of damage, rendering Sima’s Feedback useless against her. Examples include Zhang Chunhua.",
      "Multiple Damage Dealers: Characters capable of dealing multiple instances of damage can exploit Sima Yi’s \"per instance\" card-stealing ability, making it more difficult for him to recover multiple cards quickly.

      "If Xiahou Dun is on the verge of death, he cannot activate \"Unyielding\" until he has been healed back to life. This means that in a final act of revenge, if Xiahou Dun dies, he does not get to flip a judgment card.",
      "If an enemy who attacks Xiahou Dun has only one hand card, they will automatically suffer the damage from \"Unyielding\" without the option of discarding.",
      "When characters like Da Qiao or Xiao Qiao transfer damage or an attack to Xiahou Dun, the original attacker remains the target of \"Unyielding.\" However, if Xiao Qiao reflects damage from Xiahou Dun back to him, Xiahou Dun himself becomes the target of his own ability—an undesirable situation.",
      "\"Unyielding\" is not mandatory, meaning Xiahou Dun can choose not to activate it if a friendly character damages him accidentally. Additionally, Xiahou Dun can activate \"Unyielding\" if he plays a Duel and loses.",
      "If Xiahou Dun damages a character with a retaliatory ability, like Sima Yi's \"Feedback,\" they can activate their ability after \"Unyielding.\" For instance, Sima Yi can choose to suffer the damage and then use \"Feedback\" to steal one of Xiahou Dun's cards."
    ],
    "Strengths": [
      "Xiahou Dun is one of the most defensive characters in the game, boasting four units of health and a powerful deterrent ability. His \"Unyielding\" not only protects him from attacks but also punishes opponents who harm him, making enemies think twice before targeting him.",
      "As mentioned in the clarification section, Xiahou Dun can activate \"Unyielding\" even if he loses a Duel he initiated. This forces opponents into a lose-lose situation, as Xiahou Dun can deal damage whether they win or lose the Duel, putting immense pressure on enemies.",
      "Xiahou Dun's presence also acts as a deterrent for characters with low health and few hand cards. His ability may discourage the use of area attacks like Barbarians or Hail of Arrows, which could backfire on enemies with low health, forcing them to reconsider their options. This hesitation can work to Xiahou Dun's team's advantage, as opponents might avoid these powerful cards to prevent triggering \"Unyielding.\""
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
      "While Xiahou Dun boasts excellent defense, his offensive options are limited. His ability is reactive rather than proactive, which means he can only punish enemies when they attack him, rather than directly dealing damage or applying pressure himself. This leaves him less effective in situations where his team needs a more aggressive approach.",
      "As with other 'per instance' abilities, Xiahou Dun's \"Unyielding\" is not as effective against characters who deal multiple units of damage per attack. Characters capable of doing heavy damage in one action, such as through Wine-boosted attacks or multi-damage tools, can minimize the impact of his judgment-based retaliation.",
      "Though his \"Unyielding\" provides a strong deterrent, Xiahou Dun lacks abilities to directly protect or empower his teammates. His presence can discourage area attacks like Barbarians or Hail of Arrows, but beyond this passive threat, he offers little in terms of strategic support for his allies. This can leave his team vulnerable in situations where they require active assistance."
    ],
    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Damage Manipulators:Several characters can avoid Xiahou Dun’s retaliation by manipulating the source of damage. Zhang Chunhua's \"Unfeeling\" ability shields her from his \"Unyielding,\" as she doesn’t count as the source of the damage she inflicts. Diao Chan’s \"Sow Discord\" can force Xiahou Dun into a duel with an ally, and if he takes damage, he can only target that ally, not Diao Chan. Xun Yu’s \"Rouse the Tiger\" also makes an ally hurt Xiahou Dun, preventing him from targeting Xun Yu with his ability.",
      "Card Accumulators:Characters who can build up a large number of cards can manage Xiahou Dun's \"Unyielding\" ability effectively. Zhen Ji, for instance, can easily gather many cards with \"River Goddess,\" allowing her to discard extra hand cards if needed to avoid damage from Xiahou Dun's retaliation."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Xiahou Dun stands out as one of our personal favorites due to his four units of health and his ability to create a tense standoff with his \"Unyielding\" power. However, his biggest drawback is his limited contribution in team-based scenarios. Sanguosha is a game where teamwork is crucial, and Xiahou Dun's utility in supporting a larger strategy is minimal. That said, he’s far from useless. In one-on-one matches, Xiahou Dun shines, and he can cleverly take damage from Barbarians or Hail of Arrows to trigger \"Unyielding\" and catch an opponent off guard."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Xiahou Dun’s most famous historical moment came during a battle against Lü Bu's forces. While fighting on the battlefield, Xiahou Dun was struck in the eye by an arrow fired by Lü Bu’s subordinate, Cao Xing. Rather than retreating, Xiahou Dun famously pulled the arrow out of his eye, along with the eyeball itself, and, in a display of his fierce determination and warrior spirit, swallowed it. Despite his severe injury, Xiahou Dun charged forward, killing Cao Xing in retaliation.",
      "This act of valor and fearlessness became legendary, solidifying Xiahou Dun’s reputation as a loyal and courageous general. His unwavering resolve in battle parallels his in-game ability \"Unyielding,\" where he continues to fight back even when taking damage. The story of his lost eye reflects his refusal to back down, no matter the personal cost, making Xiahou Dun a symbol of resilience both in history and in Sanguosha gameplay."

      "Equipment Providers:Xiahou Yuan benefits from characters who can offer him equipment, which is vital for triggering the second option of \"Godspeed.\" Chen Gong, Zhang He, and the pair Zhang Zhao & Zhang Hong are valuable allies in this regard, as they can transfer equipment to Xiahou Yuan, enabling him to sustain his aggressive tactics.",
      "Defensive Countermeasures:Characters with strong defenses, such as Liu Shan, Zhen Ji, Zhao Yun, and Fire Zhuge Liang, make it challenging for Xiahou Yuan to land effective attacks. His \"Godspeed\" strategy may fall short against these characters, as their abilities either Escape attacks or mitigate damage, reducing his effectiveness.",
      "Retaliatory Dangers:Xiahou Yuan must be cautious when targeting characters with retaliatory abilities, such as Xiahou Dun, Fa Zheng, and Sima Yi. Their abilities trigger with every attack, making it costly for Xiahou Yuan to use \"Godspeed\" repeatedly on them. These characters can turn Xiahou Yuan's aggressive attacks against him, draining his resources and health quickly."

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Xiahou Yuan is a character designed to prey on the weak. He excels at finishing off vulnerable enemies, especially when they lack Escape cards. Timing is critical: using option 1 of \"Godspeed\" to defeat a rebel allows Xiahou Yuan to capitalize on the three-card bounty during his action phase. His abilities demand careful resource management, and using \"Godspeed\" too frequently can leave him vulnerable.

His ability to skip phases to attack quickly mirrors the urgency and rapid tactics for which he was famous.

Always ensure you have at least one Attack card before activating \"Bare the Chest\" to avoid wasted opportunities. Additionally, be aware that opponents often save their Escapes specifically for Xu Chu's turn. It’s not uncommon for enemies to appear to have no Escapes after your teammates’ attacks, only to suddenly produce one during your turn."

      "Red-Attack Bypassers: Characters like Guan Yu, Zhao Yun, and Xiao Qiao can easily bypass Yu Jin's \"Heavy Resolve\" by using red Attack cards. Guan Yu's \"Fighting Saint\" allows him to convert any red card into an Attack, making Yu Jin's immunity to black-suited Attacks useless. Similarly, Zhao Yun's \"Dragon Courage\" lets him use red Escapes as Attacks, which are not blocked by \"Heavy Resolve.\" Xiao Qiao's \"Beauty\" turns her spades into hearts, so her spade Attacks become heart Attacks, again bypassing Yu Jin's power.",

Zhang Jiao's \"Thunderclap\" inflicts damage by flipping judgment cards, which makes Yu Jin’s \"Heavy Resolve\" irrelevant since it only protects against black-suited Attacks.",
      "Supportive Loyalists: When Cao Cao is the king, Yu Jin makes a strong loyalist due to his ability to gather Escapes. Since Yu Jin's immunity to black-suited Attacks makes him harder to damage, he can focus on storing these cards for Cao Cao's benefit. This synergy works especially well because it provides Cao Cao with defensive resources without Yu Jin taking much damage."

      "Yu Jin’s defensive ability with \"Heavy Resolve\" is often seen as underwhelming because it doesn’t contribute much to a team’s success. His lack of offensive presence and easily bypassed defense by red-suited Attacks makes him a passive character. When using Yu Jin, remember not to equip armor, even if it's Eight Trigrams, as his ability is meant to be superior to any form of armor. Unfortunately, this design choice leaves Yu Jin with very little appeal."

He managed to keep the army together and safely escort Cao Cao to safety. This showed his steadfast nature and loyalty, traits reflected in his ability to defend against a majority of Attacks in the game.",
      "However, despite his loyalty and discipline, Yu Jin's story takes a tragic turn. During the Battle of Fancheng, he surrendered to Guan Yu after heavy flooding trapped his forces. This act of surrender, seen as a stain on his honor, led to his eventual execution by Cao Pi. Yu Jin’s \"Heavy Resolve\" reflects the strong defensive will he had on the battlefield, but his inability to maintain this under extraordinary pressure mirrors the weaknesses seen in his lack of offense in the game. His strict adherence to his duty and the role he played in stabilizing chaotic situations, as well as his inability to recover from overwhelming conditions, tie directly into the mechanics of his character card in Sanguosha."

However, be wary of Zhuge Liang or Sima Yi, who can disrupt her \"River Goddess\" ability; consider targeting them to mitigate their impact. Additionally, at the end of your turn, discard all Escape cards, as \"Overturned Country\" makes them redundant. Focus on keeping useful black Attacks or black Negates to maximize your strategic options."

      "Zhen Ji’s life story intertwines with her in-game abilities, reflecting her complex role in the Three Kingdoms period. Initially married to Yuan Xi, the second son of warlord Yuan Shao, she remained in Ye while her husband managed You Province. After the fall of Yuan Shao and his sons, Cao Cao’s son, Cao Pi, met Zhen Ji during the Battle of Ye and was captivated by her beauty. This led to their marriage, where she bore him a son, Cao Rui, who would later become the second emperor of Cao Wei.",
      "Zhen Ji's abilities reflect her adaptability and strategic acumen. “River Goddess” mirrors her historical role in navigating the shifting political landscape, allowing her to adapt and maximize her resources. Her ability to manipulate judgment cards reflects her skill in managing complex situations and alliances. Similarly, “Overturned Country” underscores her capability to use her resources effectively, turning any black card into an Escape, much like how she managed her position in the imperial court with grace and strategic insight.",
      "However, her life took a tragic turn when Cao Pi began favoring other concubines, leading to her execution. Despite her unfortunate end, Zhen Ji was honored by her son, Cao Rui, who ordered her worship in the ancestral temple. Her story and abilities reflect her historical significance and her ability to navigate and influence her circumstances with remarkable skill."

His skill in battle was most evident during campaigns against the Wuhuan, where his aggressive leadership earned him great renown.",

This mirrors his historical reputation as a fearless military leader who preferred action over strategy.",
      "However, when Cao Pi ascended to power after Cao Cao's death, the power struggle within the family became more pronounced. Cao Pi, cautious of potential threats, removed Cao Zhang’s military authority, but rather than executing him, Cao Pi spared his life and exiled him. Cao Zhang was no longer considered a threat after relinquishing his troops, showing that his role was primarily military, not political. This element of his life—being removed from the political sphere yet surviving—further ties into his in-game representation, where he is focused solely on combat and leaves political strategies to others."

Zhang Jiao’s \"Dark Magic\" can help Wang Yi pass a difficult judgment by flipping the result to a favorable suit, especially when they are on the same team. On the other hand, Sima Yi’s \"Devil\" ability could disrupt her judgments if he is an opponent, flipping a red card that could block her abilities. However, Wang Yi’s \"Chastity\" triggers early, giving her an edge by forcing Sima Yi to respond to her judgment, which limits his options.",
      "Support from Healers:Characters like Wu Guotai and Hua Tuo can keep Wang Yi alive at low health, which enables her to continue maximizing \"Secret Plan\". Since \"Secret Plan\" allows her to draw more cards based on the difference between her current and maximum health, healers ensure she stays in the game long enough to consistently support her team with extra resources.",
      "Interaction with Cao Zhi:Cao Zhi's \"Fallen Bloom\" can benefit from Wang Yi’s tendency to flip black-suited judgment cards, especially clubs. While this creates synergy if they are on the same team, it can also be risky if they are opponents. Wang Yi may inadvertently provide Cao Zhi with opportunities to trigger his ability, which could backfire on her team.",
      "Countered by Ma Dai:Ma Dai’s \"Sneak Attack\" can be a serious threat to Wang Yi.

      "Wang Yi stands out among fan-made characters due to her strong synergy between \"Chastity\" and \"Secret Plan\", reminiscent of Guo Jia's style. Though her abilities hinge on being damaged, players should be cautious not to overestimate her resilience.

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Wang Yi, referred to as Lady Wang in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, is portrayed as a heroic figure with strong convictions and undying loyalty to her family and country. She was the wife of Zhao Ang, an official under the Han dynasty, and she became renowned for her involvement in the resistance against Ma Chao, who had rebelled against Cao Cao's control over Liang Province.",
      "During the Siege of Jicheng, when Ma Chao's forces attacked the city, Wang Yi actively participated in the defense. She donned a battle dress, armed herself with a bow and arrows, and rallied the defenders. In the novel and historical records, she is depicted as raising morale by handing out her personal accessories as rewards to the soldiers. Her resolve was unshakable, even as the city ran out of supplies, and the defenders began to starve. When Zhao Ang’s superior, Wei Kang, considered surrendering to Ma Chao, Wang Yi vehemently opposed the idea, insisting that they should continue to fight and uphold their honor, rather than capitulate to the enemy.",
      "Her actions went beyond just physical participation. Her unwavering moral stance inspired her husband to continue fighting, despite the peril they faced. Her resolve is reflected in her ability \"Chastity\" in Sanguosha, where she manipulates judgment cards to control her fate, much like how she used her intelligence and strength of character to outwit Ma Chao. Her determination to protect her family and people, even when the city was on the brink of collapse, mirrors her ability to withstand challenges in the game, symbolizing her resilience in both history and gameplay.",
      "When Ma Chao eventually captured Zhao Ang, Wang Yi played a key role in keeping her husband alive by skillfully interacting with Ma Chao’s wife, Lady Yang. Wang Yi gained Lady Yang’s trust, allowing her husband to survive under Ma Chao’s rule, all while secretly plotting his downfall. This cunning and strategic behavior is represented by her \"Secret Plan\" ability in the game, which allows her to assist her allies when wounded, much like how she offered Zhao Ang and his allies strategic advice in a time of crisis.",
      "The ultimate culmination of her efforts came when Zhao Ang and Wang Yi, along with other loyalists like Yang Fu, successfully conspired to drive Ma Chao out of Liang Province. Despite the fact that their son, Zhao Yue, was being held hostage by Ma Chao, Wang Yi did not hesitate to support the rebellion, believing that righteousness was more important than the life of her son. Her bravery, along with Zhao Ang’s strategic attacks, ultimately led to Ma Chao’s defeat and escape. Wang Yi’s participation in all nine of her husband’s attacks on Ma Chao demonstrates her warrior spirit and dedication to justice.",
      "Wang Yi's depiction in the novel aligns closely with her abilities in the game. Her refusal to submit to Ma Chao’s forces and her clever maneuvering within enemy ranks are represented in her abilities, making her a formidable presence on the battlefield, both historically and in Sanguosha."

      "Cheng Yu is a flexible general who excels at disrupting opponents' strategies and maintaining card advantage. His \"Coercion\" lets him control key resources from opponents, while \"Foresight\" ensures he never runs out of cards.

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Cheng Yu was a key figure during Cao Cao's campaigns, especially known for his strategic brilliance. One of his most famous moments came when Lu Bu launched an attack on Cao Cao's base in Yan Province while Cao Cao was away on a campaign in Xu Zhou. As Lu Bu seized control of much of the region, many officials surrendered, leaving only three counties—Juancheng, Dong'e, and Fan—holding out in defense.",
      "At this critical moment, Cheng Yu was stationed in Juancheng with Cao Cao’s chief strategist, Xun Yu. Realizing that the defense would only succeed if the remaining counties worked together, Xun Yu asked Cheng Yu to take charge of Dong'e County, where his influence as a native could rally support. While Xun Yu oversaw Juancheng’s defenses, Cheng Yu set off for Dong'e, but on the way, he passed through Fan County. There, Lu Bu’s official, Si Yi, was attempting to persuade the local prefect to switch allegiances.",
      "Cheng Yu acted swiftly. He met with the prefect and, through a combination of persuasion and strategic insight, convinced him not only to reject Lu Bu’s offer but to kill Si Yi. After securing Fan County’s loyalty, Cheng Yu continued to Dong'e, where local officials Xue Ti and Zao Zhi had already begun organizing the defense. Cheng Yu further reinforced their efforts by deploying his cavalry to secure Cangting Ford, a key position against Chen Gong.",
      "Thanks to Cheng Yu’s quick thinking and coordination, the three counties were able to hold out against Lu Bu's forces until Cao Cao returned from Xu Province. This victory not only preserved Cao Cao's control of Yan Province but also demonstrated Cheng Yu’s ability to unite factions and defend against overwhelming odds.",
      "This moment in history directly ties into Cheng Yu’s \"Coercion\" ability in Sanguosha. His use of clever tactics to manipulate opposing forces and protect vital resources mirrors his card-stealing and disruption abilities in the game. Additionally, his \"Foresight\" ability reflects the calm, calculated planning he displayed, ensuring the long-term defense of Cao Cao’s stronghold.",
      "Later, when famine and repeated losses to Lu Bu wore down Cao Cao’s forces, Cao Cao even considered surrendering to Yuan Shao. It was Cheng Yu who boldly rebuked him, declaring that it would be disgraceful for someone as talented as Cao Cao to submit to a man of inflated reputation. Cheng Yu’s words, combined with his earlier success in defending the region, reinvigorated Cao Cao, convincing him to continue the fight despite overwhelming challenges."

He harbored dreams of establishing his own independent regime, a sentiment encouraged by the devious Jiang Wei, who sought to reclaim power for Shu. Zhong Hui’s rebellion began after he manipulated his army into believing that they could overthrow the ruling Wei court and claim Shu for themselves.",

In the end, Zhong Hui’s coup failed, and he, along with Jiang Wei and the rest of the rebels, was executed. Zhong Hui’s story is a tragic one, marked by his ambition, which ultimately led to his downfall. His in-game abilities reflect this ambition and betrayal, with \"Plotting for Power\" symbolizing his scheming nature and \"Insurrection\" representing his doomed attempt at rebellion."

His most famous story, which is represented by his \"Weigh the Elephant\" ability in Sanguosha, reflects his ingenious solution to the problem of determining the weight of an elephant by applying the principle of buoyancy. This clever approach, while not formalized as a scientific theory in ancient China, demonstrated an empirical understanding of buoyancy, something later attributed to Archimedes in the West.",
      "Cao Chong’s brilliance and problem-solving skills were further highlighted by his ability to use wisdom in practical matters, such as when he skillfully resolved the \"Rodents Incident.\" By simulating his own misfortune with rats to ease the anxiety of storekeepers whose negligence had damaged Cao Cao’s saddle, Cao Chong showed not only intelligence but also kindness and empathy. These qualities are captured in his \"Benevolence\" ability, which mirrors his historical reputation for compassion and his actions to support and protect those around him.",

      "Man Chong's defense of Hefei is his most famous achievement. This period was marked by Eastern Wu's persistent attempts to break through Wei's defenses, with Sun Quan himself leading the forces. Man Chong's foresight and tactical acumen allowed him to predict and counter Wu's strategies, including one instance where he accurately deduced that Wu forces would use fire to attack his camp by the lake. His readiness helped Wei's army repel the attack and secure their position.",
      "This tenacity in holding the line against Sun Quan's repeated invasions mirrors his earlier involvement in the Battle of Fancheng, where he assisted Cao Ren in defending the city from Guan Yu's siege during a catastrophic flood. Despite the seemingly impossible odds, Man Chong convinced Cao Ren to stand firm, leading to eventual reinforcement and the breaking of Guan Yu's siege. His actions at Fancheng were rewarded, and his reputation for loyalty and bold decision-making became solidified.",
      "Man Chong’s ability to make decisions under extreme pressure—executing Cao Hong’s retainers against direct orders, and refusing to abandon Fancheng despite overwhelming odds—highlight his unshakable resolve and strong sense of duty, qualities that both impressed and benefited Cao Cao’s administration.",
      "His cautious approach, yet willingness to act decisively, was also seen when he advised the Wei emperor Cao Rui not to commit to a flawed military strategy against Wu, foreshadowing the catastrophic defeat of Cao Xiu in 228. Man Chong's insight, though unheeded in that instance, underscored his deep understanding of military tactics and his meticulous nature.",
      "In both military and administrative roles, Man Chong’s methods were harsh but effective. His approach to rooting out corruption and destroying local strongholds often involved extreme measures, but these efforts contributed significantly to stabilizing key territories for Cao Wei. Man Chong’s strict adherence to the law and refusal to show leniency even to Cao Hong's retainers won him favor with Cao Cao, who valued loyal service over personal connections.",
      "Through Man Chong’s varied roles—whether defending the empire at Hefei, strategizing against Guan Yu at Fancheng, or administering Runan Commandery—his relentless dedication to Wei’s stability was a defining feature of his career. His defensive strategies not only secured vital territories but also became legendary."

      "Wang Yi's abilities in this version seem less impactful compared to the original, particularly due to her reliance on teammates and her reduced draw power. While \"Chastity\" helps against certain threats like Ma Chao, her overall potential is lower than her previous incarnation, which could draw significantly more cards per turn. The original Wang Yi's high turnover of cards was more dynamic, making her a more aggressive and independent character. Still, Wang Yi's \"Chastity\" can be a useful tool when opponents target her with inevitable damage, offering some tactical counterplay."

      "Wang Yi was the wife of Ma Qiu, and his family served under Zhang Lu, a warlord in the Hanzhong region, but tragedy struck when Ma Chao rebelled against Cao Cao and eventually caused the downfall of his own clan. Ma Chao’s campaign led to the deaths of many in the Ma family, including Wang Yi’s husband and father-in-law. As a result, Wang Yi harbored deep resentment against Ma Chao, vowing to avenge her fallen family members.",
      "Wang Yi’s courage and determination are well-recorded. She attempted to assassinate Ma Chao and actively participated in efforts to protect her new household and Zhang Lu's regime against Ma Chao's advances. Her famous vow to kill Ma Chao, combined with her resolve in difficult circumstances, earned her a reputation as one of the rare female figures of the time known for seeking vengeance. Although she was ultimately unable to kill Ma Chao, her fierce loyalty to her family and dedication to her cause left a strong impression.",
      "\"Chastity\" reflects her unyielding determination and willingness to sacrifice for her cause. In the game, when she chooses to lose health to discard one of her opponent's cards, it mirrors her selfless devotion to avenging her family, no matter the cost to herself. This aligns with her historical personality, showing a willingness to endure personal harm in pursuit of her greater goal.",
      "\"Secret Plan\" relates to her strategic cunning. Historically, Wang Yi was not just driven by emotion; she also utilized planning and foresight to defend against Ma Chao's threat. In the game, \"Secret Plan\" allows her to carefully distribute cards to her allies, symbolizing her ability to rally support and strategically prepare for future conflicts, much like how she tried to gather resources and allies to resist Ma Chao.",

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Cao Zhen is a defensive and disruptive character who excels at limiting the attack potential of enemies and gathering resources through Escape usage. His strength lies in his ability to manipulate the flow of combat by reducing the number of attacks his opponents can use.

      "Han Hao and Shi Huan were two generals who served under Cao Cao. They were entrusted with leading important military campaigns and overseeing key defenses, demonstrating both caution and boldness in their strategies. Han Hao was known for his prudence and discipline, often organizing the defense of key regions, while Shi Huan was more aggressive, frequently leading offensives in Cao Cao's campaigns. Together, they embodied the balance between careful planning and daring execution.",
      "In Sanguosha, their abilities reflect this duality. \"Reckless Abandon\" ties into Han Hao's cautious nature, as he carefully uses discarded cards to place traps on opponents, weakening them. On the other hand, \"Bold Strategy\" echoes Shi Huan's boldness in striking enemies before they can execute their plans, intervening in judgments to disrupt their actions. This dynamic duo's combination of calculated defense and aggressive disruption is a fitting representation of their historical roles as trusted commanders in Cao Cao's army."

      "Cao Chong was a son of Cao Cao, the warlord who laid the foundation for the state of Cao Wei. A child prodigy renowned for his intelligence and compassion, Cao Chong is most famously remembered for solving the problem of weighing an elephant. When Sun Quan sent an elephant as a gift, Cao Cao wanted to determine its weight but found no practical method. Cao Chong proposed using the principle of buoyancy: placing the elephant on a boat, marking the water level, and then replacing the elephant with objects of known weight until the water level matched. This brilliant solution demonstrated his ingenuity at a young age, an ability mirrored in his Sanguosha ability \"Weigh the Elephant.\"",
      "Cao Chong was also known for his kindness and understanding, traits reflected in his ability \"Benevolence.\" For instance, he intervened in cases of injustice, cleared tens of wrongly accused individuals, and spoke on behalf of officials who committed minor mistakes, persuading Cao Cao to pardon them. His compassion extended to everyday life; in one story, he cleverly saved storekeepers from punishment after rats damaged Cao Cao’s saddle, by pretending his own clothes were also ruined by rats and calming his father’s anger with humor.",
      "Cao Chong's intelligence and benevolent personality made him stand out among his siblings, and he became a favorite of Cao Cao. His father even considered naming him as his heir, but Cao Chong tragically died at the age of 12 due to illness. His premature death was a profound loss for Cao Cao, who mourned deeply and often reminisced about his late son. Posthumously, Cao Chong was honored with noble titles, reflecting his extraordinary potential and the impact he left behind despite his short life.",
      "In Sanguosha, Cao Chong’s abilities encapsulate both his brilliance and compassion. \"Weigh the Elephant\" pays homage to his problem-solving skills, while \"Benevolence\" captures his selflessness and willingness to protect others, aligning his historical legacy with his gameplay role."

As Da Qiao frequently uses Capture due to \"Country Scene,\" Sima Yi can force her enemies’ judgments to fail, amplifying her disruption. While Zhang Jiao can swap judgments to help allies, he cannot directly interfere with Capture as much because he only manipulates black-suited cards, and Capture requires hearts to pass.",
      "Card Providers:Da Qiao benefits greatly from teammates who can supply her with diamond-suited cards.

      "Da Qiao is an excellent support character, particularly in team scenarios where her abilities can control the flow of battle. \"Displace\" offers a unique defensive edge, allowing her to redirect enemy attacks while \"Country Scene\" can consistently disrupt enemy plans.

After Sun Ce’s untimely death, Da Qiao chose not to remain active in the administration of the state. Instead, she left political control to her husband’s younger brother, Sun Quan, which helped stabilize the country during a time of uncertainty. Da Qiao’s decision allowed the Sun family’s rule to continue without internal conflict, as she avoided placing undue power in the hands of herself or her young child. Although she had little direct involvement in military or political affairs, her loyalty to the family and willingness to step aside for the greater good contributed to the stability of Wu during its early years."

Despite being outnumbered and deep behind enemy lines, he successfully completed the attack without losing a single man. This feat showcases Gan Ning's daring nature, strategic mind, and ability to take calculated risks—qualities that are reflected in his \"Surprise\" ability in Sanguosha.

This deception allowed Huang Gai to approach Cao Cao's fleet with ships filled with flammable materials.

He waited patiently for Guan Yu to lower his guard, pretending to be ill and gradually reducing the visible military presence near the border, leading Guan Yu to believe that Wu was not a threat. When Guan Yu was preoccupied with a northern campaign against Cao Cao, Lu Meng seized the opportunity and launched a surprise attack on Jingzhou. His forces, disguised in white robes, crossed the Yangtze River at night and swiftly took the city without much resistance.",
      "This event is reflected in Lu Meng’s Sanguosha ability \"Self-Restraint,\" which mirrors his patience and long-term planning. By withholding direct attacks and waiting for the right moment, much like how he waited to strike at Guan Yu, Lu Meng in the game can accumulate cards and unleash them at the opportune time, making him a formidable opponent when the situation is in his favor. The story of his patience at Jingzhou aligns perfectly with his strategic gameplay, where biding his time and gathering resources often leads to a sudden and overwhelming strike."

      "Lu Su was a key figure in the history of the Three Kingdoms period, known for his diplomatic skills and generosity.

This act of kindness secured Sun Ce’s appreciation and helped Lu Su rise within the ranks of Wu.",
      "Later, Lu Su became a crucial diplomat between the state of Wu and its allies. After the death of Sun Ce, Lu Su served as a trusted advisor to Sun Quan and played a central role in negotiating the famous Sun-Liu alliance against Cao Cao. Acting as Wu’s ambassador, he successfully established a partnership with Liu Bei, forming a coalition that would go on to defeat Cao Cao’s forces at the Battle of Red Cliffs.",
      "In the game, Lu Su’s abilities, \"Charity\" and \"Alliance,\" reflect his historical roles. His willingness to share resources with others is mirrored in \"Charity,\" where he redistributes cards to those in need. Similarly, \"Alliance\" echoes his role as a mediator, facilitating exchanges between different factions to maintain balance and stability in the battlefield. These abilities showcase Lu Su’s diplomatic finesse and his impact on the alliances that shaped the course of history during the Three Kingdoms era."

    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Card-Dependent Characters:Lu Xun’s ability to quickly refresh his hand through \"Linked Camps\" synergizes well with characters who benefit from managing hand cards. For example, when Zhang Liao uses \"Raid\" to deplete hand cards, Lu Xun can easily recover without a major setback. Similarly, when paired with Sun Ce, especially if Sun Ce is king, the \"Takeover\" ability allows both to strategically deplete cards, making \"Linked Camps\" activate more frequently and giving Lu Xun flexibility in managing his hand.",
      "Vulnerable to Aggressive Attackers:Lu Xun struggles against powerful offensive characters who can deal continuous damage. Characters like Lu Bu, Xu Chu, Ma Chao, and Zhang Fei can easily exploit Lu Xun’s lack of direct defense mechanisms. Their relentless attack patterns can overwhelm Lu Xun, leaving him with little recourse, even though he can draw cards with \"Linked Camps.\" The continuous assault leaves him vulnerable despite his steady hand replenishment."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Lu Xun is a well-rounded character with strong self-sustaining abilities, but he requires some luck and careful planning to draw useful cards at the right time. While his \"Linked Camps\" ability ensures that he is rarely without cards, his effectiveness diminishes when faced with offensive-heavy characters, and he struggles to support his team. Lu Xun shines in smaller games or one-on-one encounters, but he becomes more vulnerable as the number of players increases. His immunity to Steal and Capture is also less impactful as more expansions are added, diluting the presence of these tool cards."

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Lu Xun’s card abilities mirror his historical legacy as a brilliant and resourceful strategist. His most famous victory came during the Battle of Yiling, where he successfully repelled Liu Bei’s invasion. Using his intelligence and patience, Lu Xun devised a series of linked camps to outlast Liu Bei’s forces. Once the Shu army was stretched thin and vulnerable, Lu Xun set fire to the camps, leading to the total destruction of Liu Bei’s army and cementing his reputation as one of Wu’s greatest military minds. This careful, deliberate strategy is reflected in his card abilities, which allow him to sustain himself and wait for the opportune moment to strike."

      "Sun Jian was a pivotal figure during the late Han Dynasty. Known for his bravery and martial prowess, Sun Jian participated in the coalition against Dong Zhuo, making a name for himself by securing the Imperial Seal, a symbol of authority that would later play a crucial role in his family’s rise to power.",
      "Sun Jian met his untimely death in a battle against Liu Biao while trying to assert control over Jing Province. He was ambushed during one of his campaigns, and this led to his defeat. However, Sun Jian’s legacy did not end with his death. His son, Sun Ce, later saw a vision of his father while staying with Yuan Shu, which inspired him to trade the Imperial Seal for troops. With these forces, Sun Ce embarked on a campaign to establish the Sun family’s dominance south of the Yangtze River, laying the foundation for the state of Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. Sun Jian’s legacy of bravery and determination is reflected in his \"Brave Spirit\" ability, which emphasizes his relentless nature, even when faced with overwhelming odds."

      "Sun Quan is a favorite among beginner players and remains one of the most well-rounded characters in the game.

His biggest weakness is his inability to directly assist his teammates, but this is compensated by his flexibility.

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Sun Quan was a master of diplomacy and strategy, successfully navigating the turbulent politics of the Three Kingdoms era. As the ruler of Eastern Wu, he demonstrated remarkable skill in maintaining a delicate balance of power between the two larger rival kingdoms, Shu and Wei. Throughout his reign, Sun Quan alternated between allying with Shu and Wei, using these relationships to keep Wu relevant and prevent either of the other two from gaining too much power. This allowed Wu to maintain its independence and strategic significance in the ongoing conflict, even though it was often the smallest of the three kingdoms.",
      "His ability to trade alliances reflects his understanding of the shifting political landscape. One of his most notable moves was his partnership with Liu Bei of Shu to defeat Cao Cao of Wei at the famous Battle of Red Cliffs. Later in his reign, he shifted his alliances, aligning more closely with Wei when it served his kingdom’s interests.",
      "This political maneuvering aligns with Sun Quan's card abilities in Sanguosha. His \"Reconsider\" ability, which allows him to discard and draw cards, mirrors his historical adaptability and tactical shifts. Just as he could adjust his alliances to maintain balance, in the game, Sun Quan can cycle through his cards to adapt to changing situations. His \"Rescued\" ability as a king also reflects his reliance on loyal followers and the support of his people, just as his rule was propped up by his alliances with talented generals and the loyalty of his subjects in Wu."

      "Historically, Sun Shangxiang was the sister of Sun Quan, and she is most famously remembered for her marriage to Liu Bei. This marriage was arranged as part of an alliance between Liu Bei and Sun Quan. However, Sun Shangxiang was known for her martial prowess and independent spirit, traits that often conflicted with her role as a noblewoman.",
      "According to the stories, on the night of her wedding to Liu Bei, when he entered her chambers, he found the walls adorned with weapons—swords, bows, and other arms. Startled by the display, Liu Bei asked for the weapons to be removed, symbolizing a shift in Sun Shangxiang's life from her warrior-like nature to her new role as a noble lady of a great state.",

Cao Cao can then use \"Evil Hero\" to retrieve the card and play it again, forming a continuous loop as long as Xiao Qiao has heart or spade cards. Be mindful of ally health when using this strategy.",
      "Card Draw Assistance:When Yuan Shao uses \"Hail of Arrows,\" Xiao Qiao can pass damage back to him, allowing him to draw more cards. While similar to the Cao Cao combo, it’s less reliable since Yuan Shao may lack the cards to sustain the loop.",

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Xiao Qiao is a versatile character who excels in any role, but she requires careful attention to how and where she passes damage. For beginner players, she may seem overpowered, but her true power lies in tactical decision-making. It's usually best to pass damage to a full-health enemy, as they will only draw one card. If an enemy has more than two units of damage, passing damage to them is risky unless they are an ally."

      "Xiao Qiao, known for her beauty, was married to Zhou Yu, the brilliant strategist of Wu. During Zhuge Liang's southern campaign, he cleverly used a rumor to manipulate Zhou Yu, claiming that Cao Cao had designs on both Xiao Qiao and her sister, Da Qiao. This enraged Zhou Yu, convincing him to aid Liu Bei and resist Cao Cao’s invasion. Their united effort culminated in the legendary Battle of Red Cliff, where Cao Cao’s forces were decisively defeated. Xiao Qiao’s connection to Zhou Yu plays into her role in Sanguosha, as her defensive abilities often revolve around protecting herself and indirectly influencing battles, much like how her presence motivated Zhou Yu to act decisively.",
      "Additionally, Xiao Qiao's representation as a \"defensive flower\" fits her historical image as one of the famed beauties of the era, influencing powerful men and the course of history."

      "Extending Protection:Xu Sheng can extend the effects of powerful defensive abilities like Fire Zhuge Liang’s \"Heavy Fog.\" By flipping Zhuge Liang after a successful attack, Xu Sheng can delay Zhuge Liang’s next action phase, prolonging the defensive effects of \"Heavy Fog\" and protecting the entire team for a longer period.",

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Xu Sheng’s \"Broken Arms\" makes him a powerful force in any match, especially against characters with lower health totals. His ability to deny enemies their turns and restrict card draws puts immense pressure on foes. When facing tough enemies, Xu Sheng can weaken them with tool cards like Barbarians or Hail of Arrows, then finish them off with \"Broken Arms.\" However, managing when to use this ability is crucial, as giving enemies too many cards can backfire."

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Xu Sheng was one of the most prominent generals in the kingdom of Wu during the Three Kingdoms period, known for his unwavering loyalty to Sun Quan. Xu Sheng earned his reputation for fierce defense and skillful leadership, especially during the confrontation against Cao Pi's forces.",
      "One of Xu Sheng's most famous actions took place during the defense of Ruxu. Knowing that his forces were severely outnumbered by the Wei army, Xu Sheng used a clever strategy to deceive the enemy. He ordered the construction of fake defensive walls that gave the impression of a large, well-prepared force. This trick successfully deterred the Wei army from attacking, saving Wu from what could have been a devastating defeat. Xu Sheng’s ability to flip the tide of a battle through deception and manipulation mirrors his in-game ability, \"Broken Arms,\" where he can turn the tables on enemies by flipping their character cards and disrupting their plans.",
      "This strategic brilliance is reflected in Xu Sheng's game mechanics.

Zhang Zhao was originally recruited by Sun Ce during his campaign to conquer Jiangdong, where he impressed the young warlord with his political insight and administrative skills. Zhang Hong, who also joined during this time, worked closely alongside him, helping manage the growing territories under Wu's control.",
      "When Sun Quan succeeded his brother as the ruler of Wu, Zhang Zhao became one of his chief counselors. His advice was instrumental in stabilizing the Wu government, especially in military campaigns and political strategy. Zhang Hong, though less prominent in some accounts, also played a vital role, especially in administration. The two were key figures in shaping the development of the Wu state.",
      "During the famous Battle of Red Cliffs, which marked the beginning of the alliance between Liu Bei and Sun Quan, Zhang Zhao and Zhang Hong's counsel was invaluable. They urged Sun Quan to ally with Liu Bei against the powerful northern warlord Cao Cao, emphasizing the strategic advantages of defending the Yangtze River region. Their political maneuvering helped lay the groundwork for one of the most famous battles in Chinese history.",

Han Dang fought alongside Sun Jian in several significant campaigns, including the suppression of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the battle against Dong Zhuo. Despite his contributions, he remained relatively obscure during this period, as he operated more like a mercenary and did not receive formal titles.",
      "Following Sun Jian’s death, Han Dang continued to serve his son, Sun Ce, aiding in the conquest of the Jiangdong region. These military victories laid the groundwork for the establishment of Eastern Wu. Han Dang was eventually promoted to Colonel Who is First to Ascend. When Sun Ce was assassinated, Han Dang transferred his loyalty to Sun Quan, the younger brother of Sun Ce, and fought in numerous key battles, including the famous Battle of Red Cliffs. He also participated in the invasion of Jing Province, serving under Lu Meng.",
      "Han Dang was instrumental in helping Wu repel forces from the rival kingdom of Shu during the Battle of Xiaoting. For his service, he was promoted to General of Vehement Might and given the title of Marquis of a Chief Village. His military career continued, where he fought against Wei forces in the Battle of Jiangling and was later granted the title of Marquis of Shicheng, a prestigious honor marking his long-standing service.",

His \"Relief\" ability ties into his historical image as a loyal and effective commander who would go to great lengths to save his comrades, much like he saved Sun Quan’s forces in key moments. His \"Horsebow\" skill mirrors his reputation as a master archer and rider, highlighting his capability to strike from a distance, just as he did on the battlefield.",
      "Han Dang died in 227, just before Sun Quan officially declared himself emperor. His son, Han Zong, would later defect to Wei, which ultimately led to Han Zong’s death. Han Dang’s legacy, however, remains intact as a loyal and courageous commander who played a pivotal role in the establishment and defense of Eastern Wu."

      "Pan Zhang and Ma Zhong were key generals who served under Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period. Pan Zhang is particularly famous for his role in the capture of Guan Yu, one of Shu's greatest generals, during the Battle of Maicheng. Ma Zhong, Pan Zhang's subordinate, delivered the finishing blow by capturing Guan Yu after Pan Zhang cut off his retreat. Together, their efforts marked a turning point in the war between Shu and Wu.",
      "In Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the novel dramatizes their actions, highlighting their teamwork and cunning in battle. This historical partnership is reflected in their Sanguosha abilities, where they work together to seize weapons and punish distant enemies. \"Seize Weapon\" ties into Pan Zhang's famous capture of Guan Yu's Green Dragon Blade, while \"Silent Arrow\" represents their deadly precision and surprise tactics that helped secure key victories for Wu."

Known for his quiet and thoughtful demeanor, he preferred indirect methods to advocate his ideas. For example, if a policy proposal succeeded, he credited it to Sun Quan, and if it failed, he remained silent, avoiding public blame. His reticent nature and unwavering dedication to his principles earned Sun Quan’s trust, leading to his appointment as Imperial Chancellor. Even when faced with challenges from within the court, such as the abuse of power by Lu Yi, Gu Yong handled matters with a level head, maintaining a balance between justice and composure.",

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Sun Luban brings a unique blend of damage control and manipulation to the battlefield. Her \"Pride\" ability helps her withstand attacks from male opponents, while \"Ruin with Slander\" can shift blame or responsibility, adding layers to her gameplay strategy. Her strengths shine when she can leverage allies who provide cards or when she faces opponents unable to bypass her equipment-based defense. However, her reliance on equipment to fully activate \"Pride\" and conditional activation of \"Ruin with Slander\" requires careful resource management. Players should use Sun Luban's abilities to redirect and mitigate damage, making her a deceptively resilient and tactical character."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Sun Luban was a princess of Eastern Wu and the elder daughter of Emperor Sun Quan and Bu Lianshi. Known for her ambition and political intrigue, Sun Luban married twice, first to Zhou Xun, son of the famous general Zhou Yu, and later to Quan Cong, a high-ranking Wu general. Her courtesy name, Dahu, or \"Big Tiger,\" reflected the fierce and assertive nature attributed to her.",
      "During Sun Quan's reign, Sun Luban developed animosity toward Lady Wang, one of Sun Quan's concubines, and her son, Sun He. When Sun He became Crown Prince, Sun Luban worried he might seek revenge, so she continuously slandered both him and his mother, leading to Lady Wang’s disgrace and Sun He's eventual deposition. Sun Luban's involvement in the succession struggle reflects her \"Ruin with Slander\" ability, as she manipulated others to sow discord, often shifting the source of blame.",
      "After Sun Quan's death, Sun Luban continued her political machinations. During the regency of Sun Jun, she leveraged her influence to arrange for Sun He’s forced suicide, using her connections to secure her aims. When her sister, Sun Luyu, refused to support her, Sun Luban falsely implicated her in a conspiracy against Sun Jun, resulting in Sun Luyu’s execution. This ruthless behavior is mirrored in the gameplay mechanics of \"Ruin with Slander,\" as Sun Luban could redirect hostility to achieve her goals.",
      "When Sun Chen took over as regent, Sun Luban attempted to conspire with Emperor Sun Liang to eliminate him, but the plot was exposed. Sun Chen responded swiftly, dethroning Sun Liang and exiling Sun Luban, marking the end of her influence in Wu. Sun Luban’s reputation for manipulation and ambition is well-reflected in her card abilities, emphasizing her skill in redirecting threats and protecting herself with \"Pride\" while manipulating others into peril."

      "Zhu Huan was a prominent military general in Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. Initially serving under Sun Quan, he rose in significance after the Battle of Jiangling, eventually assuming responsibility for local defenses and handling multiple uprisings. Zhu Huan achieved his most renowned victory when he repelled a three-pronged invasion led by Wei's emperor, Cao Pi, at the Battle of Ruxu. Despite being heavily outnumbered, he successfully defended Ruxu with only 5,000 soldiers, utilizing deception to lure the Wei general Cao Ren into a vulnerable position, ultimately burning the enemy camps and capturing key enemy figures.",
      "Zhu Huan's leadership qualities extended beyond the battlefield. During a plague outbreak in Yuyao County, he distributed food and medicine to the locals, which earned him the community’s respect and strengthened his reputation. As a defender of Eastern Wu, Zhu Huan also participated in the Battle of Shiting, joining forces with Lu Xun and Quan Cong to decisively defeat Cao Xiu's massive army.",
      "Despite his remarkable contributions, Zhu Huan's pride in his independence often clashed with authority. Though he occasionally resented taking orders from others, he remained loyal and dedicated, sacrificing his wealth to support his soldiers and their families. Upon his death, Eastern Wu's financial support for his funeral reflected the high regard in which Sun Quan and his peers held him. Zhu Huan’s son, Zhu Yi, continued his legacy in the Wu military. His in-game ability, \"Lure,\" aptly reflects his real-life strategic acumen, especially his capacity to feign weakness to ensnare formidable opponents."

However, his reliance on maintaining a large hand and his lack of defense require careful resource management and positioning to avoid becoming an easy target. Players who enjoy flexibility and strategic planning will find Zhu Ran an engaging and rewarding choice."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Zhu Ran was a Chinese general of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. He grew up alongside Sun Quan, Wu's eventual emperor. Despite their close relationship, Zhu Ran initially held minor positions until he proved his merit during Lu Meng's campaign to capture Jing Province. In this campaign, Zhu Ran played a key role in the eventual defeat of Guan Yu, though Pan Zhang received greater credit for Guan Yu's capture.",
      "Zhu Ran's most famous achievement was his defense of Jiangling during Cao Pi's three-pronged invasion of Eastern Wu. With only 5,000 troops, he held the city against a Wei force that was nearly ten times larger, led by generals like Xiahou Shang and Cao Zhen. Zhu Ran's resilience and tactical brilliance, including crushing an internal plot to betray the city and burning Wei's pontoon bridges with Pan Zhang’s assistance, cemented his reputation as a formidable commander. His efforts forced the Wei forces to retreat, earning him fame and fear among Wu's enemies. ",
      "This event ties closely to his game ability, \"Nerves of Steel,\" which reflects his ability to adapt his strategy based on the situation. Whether discarding cards to weaken his opponent, gain resources, or deal direct damage, Zhu Ran’s in-game mechanics mirror his capacity to remain calm under pressure and find ways to exploit the battlefield conditions.",
      "In later campaigns, Zhu Ran continued to demonstrate strategic prowess, although his successes were mixed. He participated in offensives against Wei, such as the assault on Fancheng, but these ultimately failed to achieve significant objectives. Before his death, Sun Quan entrusted him with command of Wu's armies, signifying the emperor’s deep trust and admiration."

Selected by court officials to stabilize Wu, Sun Xiu ascended the throne.",

This strategy culminated in a treacherous banquet, where he orchestrated the downfall of Sun Chen, a powerful and overbearing regent. This historical episode inspired the card ability “Banquet of Treachery,” reflecting Sun Xiu’s political cunning and willingness to act ruthlessly to secure his rule.",
      "Despite these initial successes, Sun Xiu faced significant challenges. His reign saw ongoing internal strife and a decline in the overall strength of Wu. The increasing threat from Wei and the gradual erosion of Wu’s territorial control created a precarious situation. In an attempt to stabilize the state, Sun Xiu promoted education and governance, efforts echoed in the card ability “Promote Learning.” This ability symbolizes his historical focus on fostering intellectual development and strengthening administrative foundations, albeit with limited success in halting Wu’s decline.",
      "Sun Xiu’s military strategy also showcased his leadership, though it lacked the brilliance of his predecessors. His “Imperial Command” ability reflects his historical role as a ruler who sought to unify Wu’s forces and emphasize cohesion. However, his reign was marred by declining morale and increasing factionalism, a stark contrast to the cohesive spirit his card ability implies.",
      "Sun Xiu’s death marked the end of a reign filled with unrealized potential. His inability to secure a stable succession plunged Wu into further chaos, hastening its eventual collapse. Known posthumously as the “Lord of Lost Glory,” Sun Xiu’s rule is remembered as a poignant chapter in the history of Eastern Wu—a period defined by fleeting moments of brilliance overshadowed by the inevitability of decline."

    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Against Equipment-Dependent Opponents:Zhu Zhi is particularly effective against characters like Huang Zhong, Zhang He, and Zhang Jiao, who rely heavily on specific equipment cards for their abilities or effectiveness in battle. Removing their key items significantly hampers their impact.",

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Zhu Zhi is a control-focused character who excels in disrupting equipment-reliant strategies and providing tactical support for his team. His ability, “Stabilize the Nation,” rewards thoughtful targeting and positioning, making him an excellent choice for players who enjoy strategic and defensive gameplay. While his lack of direct offensive power requires reliance on teammates for damage, his utility in controlling the battlefield and weakening opponents ensures his place in any team composition."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Zhu Zhi was a loyal general who played a significant role in the establishment and stability of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. Zhu Zhi served under three generations of the Sun family, including Sun Jian, Sun Ce, and Sun Quan. His unwavering dedication to the Sun clan mirrors the consistent support and utility he offers in the game through his abilities.",
      "Zhu Zhi demonstrated skill as both a tactician and administrator. He earned his reputation during the campaign against Dong Zhuo under Sun Jian, where he successfully led forces against rivals in Changsha, Lingling, and Guiyang. His victories and disciplined leadership earned him rapid promotions. In the game, “Stabilize the Nation” reflects Zhu Zhi’s ability to maintain control and restore order, much like his historical role in consolidating Sun Jian’s hold over southern territories.",
      "After Sun Jian’s death, Zhu Zhi continued to advise and assist Sun Ce. Recognizing Yuan Shu’s lack of integrity, he wisely counseled Sun Ce to break away and focus on building an independent power base in Wu. As Sun Ce expanded his territories, Zhu Zhi earned acclaim for his administrative skill, particularly as the Administrator of Wu Commandery. In-game, “Stabilize the Nation” also ties to his leadership, providing strategic advantages and healing to maintain his allies' strength.",
      "Zhu Zhi’s loyalty persisted under Sun Quan, where he supported the new leader through diplomatic and military efforts. Notably, he advised against sending hostages to Cao Cao, helping preserve Wu’s independence. Zhu Zhi’s continued service in stabilizing the region, suppressing uprisings, and strengthening Sun Quan’s rule parallels the utility of “Relentless Royal Duty”, which disrupts opponents’ strategies and allows teammates to retain an advantage, much as Zhu Zhi disrupted threats to Wu’s governance.",
      "Honored late in life, Zhu Zhi was enfeoffed and recognized for his lifelong dedication. Despite receiving generous gifts and land, Zhu Zhi remained humble, choosing semi-retirement over further political ambition. His steadfast dedication to Wu, from its turbulent beginnings to its rise as a kingdom, underscores the thematic tie-in of “Relentless Royal Duty”, emphasizing his unyielding commitment to protecting the Sun family’s legacy.",
      "Through his abilities, Zhu Zhi’s character in Sanguosha captures the essence of his historical role: a tactician, administrator, and loyal supporter whose actions ensured the stability and growth of Eastern Wu."

As Dong Zhuo’s ruthless domination of the court worsened, Wang Yun devised a scheme to turn Dong Zhuo's closest ally, Lu Bu, against him. Diao Chan played a critical role in this plan.",

The tension between the two grew, and eventually, Lu Bu's loyalty to Dong Zhuo crumbled. In a dramatic conclusion to the intrigue, Lu Bu killed Dong Zhuo in a fit of rage, driven by his desire for Diao Chan. This assassination ended Dong Zhuo’s reign of terror and brought a temporary reprieve to the Han court.",

    ],
    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Hand Control and Debilitating Characters:Characters like Xu Huang and Da Qiao can exploit Dong Zhuo’s weakness to control effects. Xu Huang can easily use Starvation to prevent Dong Zhuo from drawing cards, while Da Qiao’s \"Displace\" ability can remove herself from being targeted by Dong Zhuo’s \"Garden of Lust\" and deny him the advantage of Wine.",
      "Damage Mitigation Specialists:Zhuge Liang can be a challenging opponent for Dong Zhuo. His \"Empty City\" ability allows him to avoid taking damage when his hand is empty, which could force Dong Zhuo to lose health through \"Collapse\" since Dong Zhuo may struggle to land hits on him.",
      "Low Health Manipulators:Zhou Tai's \"Refusing Death\" can be a problem for Dong Zhuo.

      "Dong Zhuo is a polarizing character in Sanguosha. His immense starting health and powerful offensive capabilities make him seem intimidating, but his reliance on \"Collapse\" can turn his strengths into weaknesses if the game drags on. Dong Zhuo’s success depends on his ability to manage his health and make careful decisions about when to reduce his maximum health or take direct damage. As a king, he can thrive with the right loyalists, but if he is not careful, he can quickly fall prey to his own \"Collapse\" ability. Be cautious about overextending, and remember that Dong Zhuo’s power lies in his ability to control the battlefield early on."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Dong Zhuo was one of the most feared and reviled figures during the late Han dynasty. Rising from humble beginnings, he seized power during the chaos following the death of Emperor Ling and the subsequent struggle for control of the imperial court. Dong Zhuo quickly placed himself in the most important government role, acting as the de facto ruler of China. He even worked to displace the young Emperor Xian in favor of his own authority, reshaping the court and asserting total dominance over the empire.",
      "To maintain control, Dong Zhuo relied heavily on the brute strength of his adopted son, Lu Bu, who acted as his enforcer. Lu Bu’s military prowess ensured that other members of the court remained in line, and Dong Zhuo’s cruelty and lack of regard for the imperial family further solidified his position as the ultimate power in the government.",
      "However, Dong Zhuo’s reign of terror did not last. His oppressive rule sparked rebellions and led to a coalition of warlords, united in their desire to overthrow him. Eventually, Dong Zhuo’s own arrogance and abuse of power led to his downfall. Lu Bu, once his most trusted ally, turned against him, killing him in a plot orchestrated by Dong Zhuo’s enemies.",
      "In the game, Dong Zhuo’s abilities reflect his historical persona. His massive health pool and dangerous offensive powers mirror his iron grip on the empire. \"Garden of Lust\" represents his decadent and immoral nature, while \"Collapse\" reflects the inevitable downfall he faced due to his unchecked ambition. Despite his early strength, Dong Zhuo’s power was fleeting, much like the way \"Collapse\" forces him to weaken as the game progresses."

      "Card Destroyers: Characters such as Zhang Jiao, Zhang He, and Gan Ning excel at reducing Gao Shun's hand cards, weakening his ability to prepare for \"Ambush.\"",
      "Retaliation Characters: Characters like Sima Yi, Xiahou Dun, Fa Zheng, and Cai Wenji have abilities that can punish Gao Shun for launching multiple attacks. Since \"Forbid Drink\" forces all Wine cards to be used as Attacks, Gao Shun cannot easily circumvent their retaliation.",
      "Attack Defense: Yu Jin's \"Heavy Resolve\" ability does not count as armor, so it cannot be bypassed by \"Ambush.\" This makes him a challenging opponent for Gao Shun to deal with effectively."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Gao Shun is a fearsome but situational general. His success relies heavily on timing and preparation, as he needs both high-numbered cards and a stockpile of Attacks to make full use of \"Ambush.\" Patience is key to maximizing Gao Shun's potential; a single well-timed turn can turn the tide of battle, especially when paired with the extra damage from \"Forbid Drink.\" However, his lack of healing options and reliance on a strong hand can make him vulnerable if the game drags on or if his enemies are able to deplete his resources. Securing armor and defensive equipment can extend his life expectancy in battle."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Gao Shun was one of Lu Bu's most capable and loyal generals, commanding his elite unit known as the \"Camp Crushers.\" His unit was famous for breaking through enemy lines with swift and devastating attacks, a fitting parallel to his \"Ambush\" ability in Sanguosha. Gao Shun's strict discipline made him a respected figure in Lu Bu's army. Despite his tactical brilliance, Gao Shun's loyalty to Lu Bu led to his downfall.",
      "After Lu Bu's defeat at the Battle of Xiapi, both Lu Bu and Gao Shun were captured by Cao Cao. Despite being offered a position under Cao Cao's command, Gao Shun refused to betray Lu Bu and remained steadfast in his loyalty. His refusal led to his execution where he went without uttering a single word, with Cao Cao reportedly lamenting the loss of such a capable general. This reflects Gao Shun’s single-minded nature in the game, where his abilities focus solely on offense with little consideration for defense, much like his unwavering dedication to his commander, even in the face of death. His \"Forbid Drink\" ability could be seen as a reflection of his stoic discipline, denying himself any indulgence, even in Wine."

However, Hua Tuo’s defensive nature makes him a priority target for enemies. If they focus their efforts on eliminating him, he often spends the majority of the game trying to keep himself alive.

He is often sought after in Romance of the Three Kingdoms for his healing abilities, tending to heroes such as Zhou Tai, Guan Yu, and even the mighty warlord Cao Cao.",
      "One of Hua Tuo’s most famous feats was treating Guan Yu’s arm. After Guan Yu had been struck by a poisoned arrow, Hua Tuo offered to perform a delicate surgery to scrape the poison from his bone. The procedure was so painful that Hua Tuo warned Guan Yu to brace himself, yet Guan Yu remained composed, playing chess while the surgery was performed, never once flinching at the pain.",
      "Hua Tuo’s end came when he was summoned by Cao Cao, who suffered from severe headaches. Hua Tuo diagnosed that surgery was required to open Cao Cao’s skull and treat his condition, but Cao Cao, fearing treachery, suspected Hua Tuo of plotting to kill him. Refusing the treatment, Cao Cao threw Hua Tuo in prison, where the great doctor eventually perished.",
      "Hua Tuo’s abilities in Sanguosha reflect his legendary status as a healer. \"First Aid\" represents his capacity to provide immediate relief in critical situations, much like his ability to perform life-saving surgeries. \"Green Vesicle\" ties into his knowledge of herbal medicine and his willingness to offer whatever resources he had to help his patients, even in desperate times.

Only Blaze and Hail of Arrows remain viable threats to him. With the addition of the Black Shield, Jia Xu becomes even harder to take down.

Soon after, their faction collapsed, showcasing Jia Xu’s foresight.",

His brilliant strategy led to the death of Cao Cao’s eldest son and forced Cao Cao to retreat. Jia Xu’s tactical expertise became renowned through this victory, demonstrating his skill in exploiting weaknesses and shaping outcomes.",
      "Later, Jia Xu came into Cao Cao’s service, where his reputation only grew. He was known for never miscalculating, making him one of Cao Cao’s most trusted advisors. Jia Xu’s ability to navigate complex political and military situations without error made him a legend in his time.",

    ],
    "Strengths": [
      "Lu Bu is a monster when he attacks someone directly. Most of the time, players will rather take the damage than spend two cards to stop it.",
      "Lu Bu is one of the best characters to use Wine with. When players hold on to an Escape for emergencies, it won't be enough.",
      "If Lu Bu has the Crossbow, he can punish people since they can't stop all the attacks.",

    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Ally or Enemy:Diao Chan can be either a fantastic friend or an annoying enemy. When she sends Lu Bu into a Duel, \"Matchless\" will activate on whoever he is fighting. Since Diao Chan chooses the combatants, she can cause Lu Bu to fight his own teammates, and because fighting back is so costly, they will always suffer damage. When they are teamed up, the couple can punish their enemies through their attacks and \"Sow Discord,\" focusing damage on a single player.",
      "Synergy with Zhang Jiao:Zhang Jiao and Lu Bu can make a powerful team. Lu Bu can pass Zhang Jiao an Escape during his turn and then attack him. When Zhang Jiao uses that Escape, he activates \"Lightning Strike.\" After that, he uses the second Escape to trigger \"Lightning Strike\" again.",

    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Lu Bu is one of the strongest characters for launching direct assaults. As long as he can reach his opponent with attacks, they will groan under his immense power. Players facing him will be forced to take damage unless they spend a massive amount of cards defending. However, Lu Bu does not fare well defensively and needs to keep attacking to stay relevant in the game. He is not designed for a defensive or passive approach and thrives in constant combat."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Lu Bu's reputation as an unstoppable force is solidified in the legendary Battle of Hu Lao Gate. After cutting down numerous enemy generals without breaking a sweat, he faced one of the most iconic duels in history: a 3-on-1 battle against the combined might of Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei. Lu Bu stood alone, deflecting each attack from the three heroes as they coordinated their efforts against him. The clash was fierce, with blows exchanged in rapid succession. Despite their combined strength, Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei could not overpower Lu Bu. Ultimately, the battle ended in a stalemate—not because Lu Bu was bested, but because his mighty steed, Red Hare, was exhausted from the relentless fighting. This forced Lu Bu to withdraw, leaving the battlefield still undefeated.",
      "This story ties closely to Lu Bu’s game abilities. His \"Matchless\" power reflects his overwhelming combat prowess, requiring opponents to use extra resources in duels and attacks, just like how Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei struggled to overpower him despite their numbers."

      "Characters That Benefit from Damage: Characters like Xiahou Dun, Sima Yi, Fa Zheng, Guo Jia, and Xun Yu have abilities that activate when they take damage.

      "Protected Characters: Characters such as Lu Xun and Zhang Chunhua, who have abilities that ensure they always have a minimum number of cards, are less affected by Pang De’s \"Sudden Attack.\" Even if Pang De discards a card from their hand, they can recover quickly."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Pang De is a versatile character, but his combination of abilities makes him less specialized than others. His blend of card destruction and offensive potential can be effective, but it also makes him less efficient in either role than characters specifically tailored for those tasks. While he may not be a top choice, he can be valuable in certain matchups and, with the right support, can cause significant disruption."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Pang De was one of the elite Xiliang cavalrymen who fought alongside Ma Chao during Ma Chao’s rebellion against Cao Cao. During Ma Chao’s defeat, Pang De was ill and was captured by Wei forces. Despite this, he later pledged his loyalty to Cao Cao and became a trusted general. During the campaign for Jingzhou, Pang De famously dueled Guan Yu in a one-on-one battle. In this duel, Pang De managed to strike Guan Yu with a poisoned arrow, but his forces were ultimately defeated due to poor strategic decisions made by his superior. After being captured, Pang De refused to surrender and was executed for his steadfast loyalty to Wei.",
      "This historical context is reflected in Sanguosha through his \"Horsemanship,\" which represents his skill as a cavalryman, allowing him to attack over greater distances, much like his role as an elite horseman. His \"Sudden Attack\" ability symbolizes his fierce, relentless aggression, particularly during his duel with Guan Yu, where he relentlessly pursued his opponent, ultimately landing a critical blow with the poisoned arrow. However, much like how Pang De’s efforts were undermined by others' mistakes, in the game, his offensive capabilities can be countered by characters with strong defenses or situational abilities, reflecting the way he was thwarted in the end."

Guan Yu quickly killed both Yan Liang and Wen Chou in battle, which not only removed two of Yuan Shao’s strongest fighters but also sowed discord between Yuan Shao and Liu Bei. Cao Cao used Guan Yu’s actions to manipulate Yuan Shao into becoming suspicious and angry with Liu Bei, further fracturing their already strained alliance. Without his top generals, Yuan Shao's military strength was severely weakened, which played a major role in his defeat at Guandu."

If Zhen Ji is an enemy, Zhang Jiao can still influence her judgments but cannot directly reduce the number of cards she gains.",
      "Card-Generating Ally: Guo Jia often pairs well with Zhang Jiao, especially when Zhang Jiao is king. Enemies hesitate to attack because attacking Guo Jia gives him card draws, which could provide Zhang Jiao with more Escapes or spade cards. When Guo Jia is an enemy, Zhang Jiao must be cautious when targeting him with \"Lightning Strike,\" as Guo Jia’s ability to draw from damage will allow him to accumulate a significant number of cards.",
      "Draw Power SynergyAs a loyalist, Yuan Shu’s massive draw power makes him a great ally for Zhang Jiao. Yuan Shu’s many card draws will often yield Escapes, allowing Zhang Jiao to continue activating \"Lightning Strike.\" However, if Yuan Shu is a rebel, this same ability makes him a dangerous opponent, as he can use his cards to disrupt Zhang Jiao.",
      "Tactical Manipulation: Zhuge Liang can be an effective ally for Zhang Jiao by manipulating judgments to help activate \"Lightning Strike.\" However, if Zhuge Liang is placed before Zhang Jiao in seating order, he can prevent Zhang Jiao from drawing Escapes during his turn, creating difficulties.",
      "Duel Instigator: Diao Chan and Lu Bu are unpredictable allies or enemies. Diao Chan may force Zhang Jiao into a duel with another male character, while Lu Bu can help Zhang Jiao activate \"Lightning Strike\" twice due to his \"Matchless\" ability. At the same time, Lu Bu’s high attack power could be a threat to Zhang Jiao if they are on opposing sides.",
      "Chain Specialist: Pang Tong can chain Zhang Jiao to his enemies, complicating the use of \"Lightning Strike\" if the enemies are chained to Zhang Jiao himself. However, if they are allies, Pang Tong can chain enemies for Zhang Jiao, allowing him to hit multiple targets with his ability.",
      "Card Support: Liu Bei can give Zhang Jiao Escapes or spade cards and attack him in the same turn to trigger \"Lightning Strike.\" This combination allows Zhang Jiao to repeatedly activate his ability without running out of cards.",
      "Damage Opportunists: Both Guan Yu and Xiahou Yuan have attack abilities that make it easier to target Zhang Jiao. These two can help Zhang Jiao trigger \"Lightning Strike\" more frequently when they are on the same side.",
      "Card Destruction Threats: Zhang Liao can destroy Zhang Jiao’s hand cards, limiting his ability to activate \"Lightning Strike.\" Gan Ning is a more significant threat as a rebel, as his card destruction is more aggressive and can strip Zhang Jiao of defensive cards more quickly.",
      "Nemesis: Huang Zhong is Zhang Jiao’s greatest counter, as his ability to make attacks inescapable nullifies \"Lightning Strike.\" Zhang Jiao must be especially wary of Huang Zhong when playing as king since Huang Zhong is often a rebel and can deal massive damage when using Wine.",
      "Immunity to Judgments: Xiao Qiao’s \"Beauty\" makes her immune to \"Lightning Strike\" by turning spade judgment cards into heart cards. This negates Zhang Jiao’s ability to deal lightning damage, and her \"Fantasy\" ability can further complicate matters by redirecting damage back to Zhang Jiao or his allies.",
      "Additional Damage Sources: These characters can damage Zhang Jiao through non-attack methods, making them effective enemies. Some examples are Yan Liang & Wen Chou, Xun Yu, and Dian Wei. Zhang Jiao must be careful around these opponents, as they can bypass his reliance on Escape cards for defense."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Zhang Jiao is one of the most complex characters in Sanguosha, requiring careful play and attention to detail. He is not recommended for beginners. Keeping a strong hand to bluff rebels into thinking you have Escapes is crucial. When playing as the king, be wary of Huang Zhong and Gan Ning, as their abilities can cripple you. Conversely, if you are a rebel attacking Zhang Jiao, being to his immediate right gives you a strategic advantage since he may think you are his loyalist."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Zhang Jiao was the leader of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, the largest uprising in Chinese history. He was a charismatic healer and religious figure who had studied the mystical arts under the guidance of an old hermit. The hermit instructed Zhang Jiao not to rebel, but he ignored this advice and rose against the Han Dynasty. As the leader of this rebellion, Zhang Jiao claimed the title of \"General of Heaven\" and led a massive peasant army. However, despite his efforts and mystical abilities, Zhang Jiao was killed in the rebellion. His death led to the gradual collapse of the Yellow Turbans, although the chaos they caused would persist and fuel the eventual downfall of the Han Dynasty.",
      "Zhang Jiao’s mystical abilities in Sanguosha reflect his historical reputation as a sorcerer, with \"Lightning Strike\" representing his use of supernatural power to harm enemies, and \"Dark Magic\" reflecting his manipulation of fate through judgment cards."

He first encountered Cao Cao’s servants during their journey to deliver oranges to the palace, where he claimed to be an old friend of the Prince of Wei. When the oranges were presented to Cao Cao, they were found to be hollow, prompting confusion. Soon after, Zuo Ci arrived at the palace, where he demonstrated that he could fill the oranges with pulp, bewildering Cao Cao.",
      "During their meeting, Zuo Ci shared a fantastic story of his years of study on Mount Emei, where he discovered The Book of Concealing Method, which gave him abilities to fly, pass through mountains, and decapitate from a distance using his mind. He offered these secrets to Cao Cao on the condition that he abandon his position and become a Daoist disciple. Cao Cao refused, stating that there was no one else to govern. Zuo Ci warned him that he might one day send a flying sword after him. Infuriated, Cao Cao accused Zuo Ci of being a spy for Liu Bei and had him imprisoned.",
      "Despite being tortured, starved, and shackled, Zuo Ci remained unharmed and unaffected, eating no food for seven days yet looking perfectly healthy. This only fueled Cao Cao's anger further, and he was left frustrated by his inability to punish Zuo Ci.",
      "At a banquet held soon after, Zuo Ci reappeared, offering to fulfill any request Cao Cao might have. To test him, Cao Cao asked for impossible items like a dragon’s liver and peonies in winter. Zuo Ci effortlessly conjured them, drawing further suspicion from Cao Cao, who accused him of trickery. Zuo Ci even produced fish from the Song River, over 500 miles away, and performed more miraculous feats, leaving the guests astounded. Despite all this, Cao Cao refused Zuo Ci’s offer to drink a cup of wine, even after Zuo Ci cut it in half to drink his part.",
      "Fearing the Daoist’s powers, Cao Cao ordered Xu Chu to capture him. Though Zuo Ci fled, Xu Chu and his men tracked him down to a flock of sheep. In a fit of frustration, Xu Chu slaughtered the sheep, but Zuo Ci vanished once again. The shepherd boy with the flock later reported hearing voices from the severed sheep heads, instructing him to place the heads back on the bodies, which revived the animals. Zuo Ci had seemingly escaped again.",
      "Determined to eliminate Zuo Ci, Cao Cao spread a description of him throughout the city. Soon, hundreds of men matching Zuo Ci’s appearance were arrested. When they were all executed, black vapor rose from their necks and coalesced into Zuo Ci’s form. Sitting atop a white crane, Zuo Ci delivered a cryptic warning to Cao Cao. Despite his soldiers' attempts to shoot him down, Zuo Ci disappeared into a storm, while the beheaded corpses arose, carrying their severed heads as they charged toward Cao Cao. This supernatural assault overwhelmed him, and Zuo Ci vanished once more, leaving Cao Cao shaken and powerless.",
      "This tale of Zuo Ci's encounters with Cao Cao highlights his mystical abilities and how they directly tie into his game character's supernatural feats in Sanguosha.

Xiao Qiao’s \"Fantasy\" can redirect damage to Hua Xiong, allowing him to draw cards based on his missing health units. This can give him a large card draw since his health limit is so high.

      "Characters with Red Attacks:Guan Yu, Guan Xing & Zhang Bao, Zhao Yun, and Wind Guan Yu are all dangerous threats to Hua Xiong.

      "Hua Xiong is a character built with strong survivability but lacks the offensive firepower to dictate the game's pace.

Gathering equipment and avoiding early exposure is key to his success. The design, while thematically tied to Guan Yu's historical battle, might overemphasize this rivalry—making Hua Xiong excessively vulnerable in games with many red-attack characters. Strategically, players should focus on defending and surviving longer to wear down opponents."

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Hua Xiong defeats several prominent generals of the coalition, including Sun Jian's officer Zu Mao and the generals Bao Zhong and Yu She. His victories caused fear and confusion among the allied warlords.",
      "However, his success was short-lived. When the famed Guan Yu volunteered to confront Hua Xiong, he swiftly defeated and killed Hua Xiong in a single stroke, famously returning while his cup of wine was still warm. This event solidified Guan Yu’s reputation as a great warrior and is one of the most well-known episodes in the early chapters of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. In this narrative, Hua Xiong's overwhelming confidence and reliance on brute force ultimately led to his downfall.",
      "Historically, Hua Xiong may not have been quite the unstoppable force depicted in the novel, but his role as a key general for Dong Zhuo shows that he was indeed a formidable military figure. His death at the hands of Guan Yu, however dramatized, became one of the defining moments in the novel’s portrayal of the struggle between Dong Zhuo and the coalition forces. This ties into his in-game ability \"Reliant on Valor,\" which mirrors his dependence on physical might and how it could ultimately lead to his defeat."

His rule was marked by caution and a defensive posture, which fits his in-game abilities that emphasize defense and survival over aggression.",
      "One of Liu Biao’s most significant encounters was with the warlord Sun Jian, who attacked Jing Province after the campaign against Dong Zhuo. Liu Biao’s forces initially struggled against Sun Jian, who had a strong reputation as a warrior. However, Sun Jian was ultimately ambushed and killed, by a subordinate of Liu Biao named Huang Zu, ending the immediate threat to Jing Province. Despite this victory, Liu Biao did not capitalize on his military success, opting to maintain his defensive stance rather than expanding his territory.",
      "Liu Biao’s inaction and hesitation are most evident in his later years when Liu Bei sought refuge in Jing Province after being defeated by Cao Cao. Liu Biao took Liu Bei in, granting him the city of Xinye. This decision set the stage for later events, as Liu Bei would use Xinye as a base to build his forces. After Liu Biao's death, his son Liu Cong surrendered Jing Province to Cao Cao without a fight a set the stage for  the famous Battle of Red Cliff, where the combined forces of Liu Bei and Sun Quan defeated Cao Cao’s much larger army.",

However, Kong Rong refused to surrender, even as other governors yielded. Despite overwhelming odds, Kong Rong chose to fight and defend his city. While he eventually required outside assistance from Liu Bei, this incident showed his resolve and his belief in righteousness over expedience.",
      "Kong Rong’s defiance in the face of Yellow Turbans directly ties into his Sanguosha ability \"Blunt Speech.\" His ability to draw cards when others are harmed reflects how he stayed sharp and resourceful even during difficult times. His \"Give and Take\" ability reflects his well-known generosity—most famously depicted in the tale of him sharing pears with his brothers as a child, a symbol of his early maturity and sense of fairness."

Yuan Shao appreciated the plan, appointing Ju Shou as an Army Supervisor and later General of Vehement Might.",
      "Throughout his service, Ju Shou repeatedly urged Yuan Shao toward prudent and calculated approaches. He advised caution in both the allocation of territories to Yuan Shao’s sons and the attack strategy against Cao Cao. Unfortunately, Yuan Shao often ignored his advice. For instance, Ju Shou’s warning about the reckless deployment of Yan Liang at the Battle of Boma was dismissed, leading to the general’s death and a blow to Yuan’s forces. Similarly, at the pivotal Battle of Guandu, Ju Shou’s recommendations for a slow, attritional strategy went unheeded, resulting in Yuan Shao’s defeat due to a raid on his supply depot at Wuchao. After Yuan’s loss, Ju Shou was captured by Cao Cao but refused to surrender. His attempt to escape captivity led to his death.",

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Lady Cai was a notable figure in the late Eastern Han Dynasty, with her influence primarily stemming from her marriage to the warlord Liu Biao, who governed Jing Province. Born into the prominent Cai family of Xiangyang, Lady Cai's family included her brother Cai Mao, who held substantial power in Liu Biao's administration, and her niece Huang Yueying, who married the famed strategist Zhuge Liang. Through these ties, Lady Cai had considerable sway over political affairs in Jing, even influencing Liu Biao's decisions on matters of governance.",
      "In her life, Lady Cai became instrumental in the intense succession dispute between Liu Biao’s sons, Liu Cong and Liu Qi. With no biological children of her own, Lady Cai supported Liu Cong, her niece’s husband, as Liu Biao's heir. Together with her brother Cai Mao, she undermined Liu Qi, often praising Liu Cong while sowing doubts about Liu Qi’s suitability. When Liu Biao fell ill, Lady Cai, Cai Mao, and their faction even prevented Liu Qi from seeing his father, solidifying her faction’s control over Jing Province. Her influence eventually led to Liu Cong's succession; however, the victory was short-lived. Liu Cong's reign ended with Jing Province’s surrender to Cao Cao, marking the beginning of Liu Bei's eventual control over the region, which became essential for the establishment of Shu Han.",
      "In Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Lady Cai’s role is even more prominent as an antagonist to Liu Bei. Described as a cunning conspirator, she is portrayed as using every possible tactic to secure Liu Cong’s succession. With her brother Cai Mao, she goes as far as plotting against both Liu Qi and Liu Bei, seeing them as threats to her son’s rule over Jing Province. The novel highlights her schemes, from advising Liu Cong to forge documents for his appointment to eventually urging him to surrender to Cao Cao when Jing was threatened. Her actions in the novel reflect her real-life ambitions but amplify her role in creating opposition to Liu Bei’s ambitions in Jing. In the game Sanguosha, her abilities \"Eavesdrop\" and \"Surrender\" represent her skill in political maneuvering and her strategic role in influencing others' decisions, whether by controlling resources or aligning with powerful allies."

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Empress Fu was the first wife of Emperor Xian, the last emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty. Known for her resistance against Cao Cao's domination of the imperial court, she became one of the final figures symbolizing the Han dynasty's waning influence. Her in-game abilities, \"One Last Chance\" and \"Plead,\" reflect her historical role as a defender of the Han dynasty and her desperate attempts to navigate treacherous political waters.",
      "Historically, Empress Fu came from a prestigious lineage. Elevated to empress consort during Emperor Xian's powerless reign, she shared her husband's struggles under the control of warlords like Dong Zhuo and later Cao Cao. Her dissatisfaction with Cao Cao culminated in a covert plea for her father Fu Wan to eliminate him. However, her letter was discovered, and Cao Cao forced Emperor Xian to depose her. She was captured, executed alongside over 100 members of her family.",
      "Empress Fu’s \"One Last Chance\" mirrors her real-life defiance, embodying her desperate bid to regain control in an environment dominated by powerful adversaries. The competition mechanic symbolizes her attempts to assert influence despite overwhelming odds. Similarly, \"Plead\" reflects her reliance on alliances, echoing her historical appeals for intervention from trusted allies like her father. Her tragic end emphasizes the risks she faced when her cries for aid went unanswered, paralleling the in-game stakes of these abilities."

After Dong Zhuo’s assassination, Li Ru attempted to continue his career under Li Jue but was denied by Emperor Xian, who held him accountable for his role in Liu Bian’s death. He was ultimately executed for his association with Dong Zhuo's crimes.",

His attempts to warn Dong Zhuo about Diao Chan's plot go unheeded, and after Dong Zhuo's death, Li Ru is executed for his complicity.",
      "The game abilities of Li Ru in Sanguosha draw heavily from his historical and literary reputation as a schemer and enforcer of Dong Zhuo’s will. \"Burn the City\" mirrors the devastation and ruthlessness associated with Dong Zhuo’s reign, symbolizing the destructive consequences of Li Ru’s strategy for moving the capital. \"Vanishing Act\" and \"Extermination\" reflect his calculated manipulation and willingness to eliminate threats through cunning tactics.

Although nominally a vassal of Cao Wei, Gongsun Yuan's ambitions led him to play a dangerous game of diplomacy, balancing between Wei and their rival state, Eastern Wu. His ability, \"Harbor Suspicion,\" reflects his duplicity and opportunistic maneuvers, often discarding alliances to further his own goals.",
      "In 237, Gongsun Yuan openly rebelled against Cao Wei by declaring himself \"King of Yan\" and aligning with Eastern Wu. This act of defiance drew the attention of the Wei emperor Cao Rui, who sent generals to suppress him. Despite forming alliances with neighboring powers, Gongsun Yuan's attempts at survival were undermined by his own mistrustful and treacherous nature. For instance, he killed Eastern Wu delegates after initially considering an alliance, sowing distrust with potential allies. This behavior parallels the strategic risks inherent in his \"Harbor Suspicion\" ability, where overextending comes at the cost of personal stability.",
      "Sima Yi led a Wei campaign to Liaodong, decisively defeating Gongsun Yuan. The rebellion ended with Gongsun Yuan’s death and the extermination of his clan, bringing Liaodong under Wei control. This swift and brutal conclusion mirrors the self-inflicted harm in his ability when obtaining cards results in health loss, emphasizing the peril of reckless overreach.",

Initially serving Han Fu, Guo Tu facilitated Han Fu’s surrender of Ji Province to Yuan Shao, joining Yuan’s court as an adviser. He famously persuaded Yuan Shao not to rescue Emperor Xian, which allowed Cao Cao to seize control of the Han court and issue imperial decrees that weakened Yuan Shao’s legitimacy. Later, during the Battle of Guandu, Guo Tu advised against salvaging supplies at Wuchao, resulting in Yuan Shao’s critical loss and the defections of Zhang He and Gao Lan. After Yuan Shao’s death, Guo Tu supported Yuan Tan in the succession conflict, contributing to the faction's fragmentation. He was ultimately killed when Yuan Tan was defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of Nanpi.",

Following the defeat at Guandu, Pang Ji slandered Yuan Shao’s loyalist Tian Feng, driving him to be executed. After Yuan Shao’s death, Pang Ji supported Yuan Shang’s claim to leadership, opposing Yuan Tan. Pang Ji’s efforts to reconcile the two brothers failed, as Yuan Tan grew distrustful of Yuan Shang’s intentions. Yuan Tan killed Pang Ji in anger during one of these failed negotiations, further deepening the division within the Yuan clan.",

      "Cao Cao stands out as one of the most powerful demigod characters in Sanguosha. His \"Tribute\" ability is remarkably versatile, providing an opportunity to gather cards from every player, especially in large games. When using Cao Cao, it’s often advantageous to take damage intentionally, such as during a Barbarian or Hail of Arrows attack, to activate \"Tribute.\" It’s also important to keep Negates on hand to defend against Capture, one of his greatest weaknesses. Strategically, even using a Blaze on himself to activate \"Tribute\" can be a valid tactic, provided he has a way to heal afterward. If facing Cao Cao, the best strategy is often to ignore him. Without damage, \"Tribute\" remains inactive, and Cao Cao cannot utilize his full potential. When forced to kill him, focus on eliminating his allies first, then confront Cao Cao when his power has weakened in the late game."

He used the emperor as a figurehead to command other warlords, positioning himself as the true power behind the throne.",
      "Cao Cao’s \"Tribute\" ability in the game reflects his strategic mastery over his enemies and allies alike. Just as he collected tribute and loyalty through political maneuvering, his in-game ability allows him to take cards from all other players after receiving damage, symbolizing his ability to turn adverse situations to his advantage. His \"Flying Shadow\" ability mirrors his prowess in battlefield mobility and protection, always staying a step ahead of those who sought to steal his influence. Through both the historical records and Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Cao Cao is remembered for his relentless ambition and strategic brilliance, which are well-reflected in his gameplay mechanics."

As the ghost of Guan Yu took control, Lu Meng cursed Sun Quan and called him a “purple-bearded rat.” Guan Yu’s spirit, speaking through Lu Meng, vowed to seek revenge for his death.

    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Sima Yi is most famous for his defense against Zhuge Liang’s Northern Expeditions during the final years of the Three Kingdoms period. Appointed as the chief military commander of Wei, Sima Yi was tasked with defending the northern borders from repeated Shu incursions led by Zhuge Liang. Although Sima Yi’s political enemies tried to undermine him and restrict his military options, he displayed remarkable patience and resilience—traits reflected in his game ability, \"Command to Endure.\"",
      "During Zhuge Liang’s campaigns, Sima Yi was often forced to endure Shu’s aggressive strategies, biding his time and conserving his forces. His orders from the Wei court frequently limited his ability to launch counteroffensives. Nevertheless, Sima Yi remained focused on defense, famously refusing to engage Zhuge Liang's forces in open battle despite constant provocations. This defensive approach allowed him to wear down the Shu forces over time, much like how Sima Yi in the game uses his Endurance Tokens to gather strength before unleashing his awakened abilities.",
      "Zhuge Liang’s eventual death from illness during the campaigns provided Sima Yi with the opportunity he had been waiting for. Once the political and military situation had shifted in his favor, Sima Yi seized the moment to decisively repel Shu’s forces and secure Wei’s northern borders. This victory laid the foundation for his later rise to power, which culminated in his family’s eventual seizure of control over the Wei government and the founding of the Jin dynasty.",
      "Sima Yi’s \"Promotion\" in the game reflects this rise in power, where he patiently endures hardship, builds his strength, and then gains access to a wide array of abilities once his political and military prowess is fully realized. \"Breaking Links\" also ties into his historical ability to turn the tide of battle by making the most of critical moments, allowing him to disrupt the flow of events and take multiple actions in quick succession, much like his historical conquest of the Wei government."

      "Misusing \"Heavy Fog\" and \"Fierce Wind\" early in the game can drain Zhuge Liang's Stars too quickly, leaving him vulnerable for the remainder of the match."

    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Damage Redirection Synergies: Characters like Xiao Qiao benefit from \"Heavy Fog\" by redirecting damage to players protected by Zhuge Liang. Since these players are immune to non-lightning damage, Xiao Qiao can activate her abilities without harming them, gaining card advantage while preserving her team’s safety.",
      "Turn Order Manipulators: Characters such as Cao Pi can exploit Zhuge Liang's abilities by forcing him to flip his general card with \"Exile.\" Since the effects of \"Heavy Fog\" and \"Fierce Wind\" persist while Zhuge Liang is flipped, this allows Zhuge Liang to extend these effects without spending more Stars.",
      "Frequent Damage Dealers: Characters who deal frequent damage, like Fire Zhuge Liang, Fire Zhou Yu, and Mountain Zhao Yun, pair well with \"Fierce Wind.\" By amplifying fire-based damage, Zhuge Liang can greatly enhance their offensive capabilities, turning them into even more lethal threats.",
      "Immunity Disruptors: Zhuge Liang’s defensive abilities are countered by characters like Zhang Chunhua, whose \"Unfeeling\" skill ignores the protection from \"Heavy Fog.\" This makes Zhang Chunhua a direct threat, as Zhuge Liang’s fog-based defenses won’t block her damage.",
      "Turn Manipulation Threats: Characters like Liu Shan, with \"Decentralization,\" can manipulate the turn order, potentially interrupting Zhuge Liang’s careful planning. By shortening the duration of his \"Heavy Fog\" or \"Fierce Wind\" effects, they can force Zhuge Liang to expend more Stars, weakening his long-term strategy."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Zhuge Liang’s strengths lie in his ability to control both offense and defense through proper Star management. Using \"Heavy Fog\" sparingly to protect key allies, while reserving \"Fierce Wind\" for critical moments when his team can deliver fire damage, ensures he stays effective throughout the game. Without careful management, Zhuge Liang can run out of Stars, making him far less useful in longer games."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "Zhuge Liang is renowned for his strategic brilliance, and one of his most famous feats occurred during the Battle of Red Cliffs. At this pivotal moment in the Three Kingdoms conflict, Zhuge Liang's ability to manipulate the elements played a critical role.",
      "Faced with Cao Cao's immense naval force, Zhuge Liang collaborated with Zhou Yu to devise a strategy that would turn the tide of battle. Recognizing that they needed a strong easterly wind to launch a successful fire attack on Cao Cao's fleet, Zhuge Liang performed a ritual. This ritual, conducted at the Seven Star Altar, is believed to have changed the direction of the wind from west to east. The sudden shift allowed Zhou Yu to set Cao Cao's ships ablaze, delivering a crushing blow to his army and securing a decisive victory for the Sun-Liu alliance.",
      "This historical event is reflected in Zhuge Liang's in-game abilities. His \"Seven Stars\" power mirrors his meticulous planning and ability to store crucial resources for the right moment. Similarly, \"Fierce Wind\" draws inspiration from the legendary wind that helped Zhou Yu's fire attack succeed. By making enemies vulnerable to fire damage, Zhuge Liang in Sanguosha captures the essence of his role in shaping the outcome of the Battle of Red Cliffs. "

His fictionalized portrayal emphasizes his role as both a spiritual leader and a military strategist. Zhang Jiao’s ability \"Peace\" reflects his movement's goal of creating harmony and equality, while \"Cycle of Heaven\" ties to his belief in cosmic cycles and divine favor.

Hua Xiong earned infamy for his ruthless efficiency in defeating several notable generals during the conflict, including Pan Feng and Bao Zhong.",
      "Hua Xiong's most famous moment came at the Battle of Sishui Pass, where he was challenged by the coalition’s forces. Despite his initial victories, Hua Xiong met his end at the hands of Guan Yu, who famously slew him in a single strike returning to finish a cup of warm wine. This story, romanticized in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, serves as the inspiration for Hua Xiong’s title, \"Hatred of Warm Wine.\"",
