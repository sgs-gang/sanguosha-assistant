      "Generals That Willingly Lose Cards: Characters like Liu Bei, Xu Shu, Lu Su, and Yuan Shu, who often lose cards intentionally, need to be wary of the Ancient Scimitar.

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "Affectionately known as 'The Punisher,' the Ancient Scimitar is best saved for the right moment. Keeping it in hand until an opponent is vulnerable allows you to catch them off guard and deal devastating damage. If you equip it too early, opponents will be cautious and make sure to hold onto cards. Without the element of surprise, it can be challenging to catch someone without cards. This weapon is most effective later in the game when players are running low on resources—this is when the Ancient Scimitar can put a definitive end to the game."

      "The Ancient Scimitar is believed to have been owned by Sun Jian. Although not mentioned in his recorded battles, Sun Jian was a fierce and aggressive warrior, making it likely he would have wielded such a powerful blade. Sun Jian’s combat career began at a young age when he fought pirates alongside his father, earning him the title 'Tiger of Jiangdong.' He later played a pivotal role in the coalition against Dong Zhuo, where he led the charge for the coalition’s eighteen lords. Sadly, Sun Jian met his end during a campaign against Liu Biao."

Excellent users include Ma Chao, Huang Zhong, and Lu Bu.",

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "The Fire Fan is a nightmare for anyone equipped with Wood Armor. It is the perfect tool to bypass the strong defense that Wood Armor provides. However, its specialization is somewhat limited. Throughout most of the game, the Fire Fan simply offers a large attack range to its user. While it’s possible to pull off strategies involving Chains, most players won’t risk equipping Wood Armor if this weapon is in play. Therefore, when you draw the Fire Fan, you gain the upper hand in pursuing an opponent. The Fire Fan carries no drawbacks, so there’s no reason not to use it to deal fire damage instead of regular damage."

He famously used fire to defeat foes like Xiahou Dun, Cao Ren, Cao Cao, and Sima Yi. Zhuge Liang often commanded smaller forces and had to rely on fire to even the odds. His strategies were consistently effective, often leaving his enemies devastated by the flames."

This motif originates from the Tale of King Mu (周王傳), which recounts the journey of King Mu, a legendary ruler of the Zhou dynasty over a thousand years before the Three Kingdoms era. King Mu's quest for immortality led him to the distant lands of Kunlun, guided by his charioteer Zao Fu and a chariot drawn by eight magnificent horses, each named after the color of its hair and imbued with symbolic meaning.",

Although Hua Liu does not appear specifically in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, its lineage and symbolism would have been widely known during that era. The breed’s association with wealth and success would have made it a desirable steed for any ambitious warlord, linking the ideals of prosperity and good fortune that echoed from ancient times into the turbulent world of the Three Kingdoms."

    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Generals Who Discard Equipment: Characters who can willfully discard equipment love the Silver Helmet since they can remove it when damaged to gain a health point while also benefiting from its use. These characters, like Xiahou Yuan, Xu Huang, Cai Wenji, Gan Ning, Da Qiao, Han Dang, Diao Chan, Zhang Jiao, Yuan Shu, and Chen Gong, often equip the helmet for later strategic use.",

Xu Chu and Zhang Jiao are notable examples of characters who suffer reduced efficiency against this armor."

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "The Silver Helmet is a defensive piece of armor with limited utility while equipped. Though it can protect against things like Lightning, there are often better options available. Its real value comes when it is removed, effectively banking a health recovery for later use. Players will try to strip the helmet from an opponent before it can be used for healing, especially when the wearer is low on health. While not the most powerful equipment in the game, the Silver Helmet can be situationally beneficial, and players often use it to capitalize on its removal."

When Ma Chao dueled Zhang Fei at the pass, neither could overpower the other, and both generals managed to capture part of the other's headgear. This battle left a deep impression on Liu Bei, who eventually won Ma Chao over to his side through Zhuge Liang's trickery. The Silver Helmet may symbolize Ma Chao’s famous helmet from these legendary duels, reflecting his formidable resilience and eventual allegiance to Liu Bei."

      "Defensive characters:They appreciate the Wood Armor because it allows them to hunker down and avoid the fray for a while. The armor's protection against Barbarians and Hail of Arrows means attackers must single them out to deal damage. Given enough time to prepare, no attack can easily penetrate their defenses. Examples include Lu Meng and Cao Ren.",

      "The Wood Armor, also known as rattan armor, was what Zhuge Liang encountered during his southern campaign against Meng Huo and the Nanman leaders. Wu Tu Gu is remembered for leading an army equipped with this armor. The soldiers were impervious to swords, arrows, and spears, making them nearly invincible. Additionally, the armor was water-resistant, and soldiers would use it as makeshift rafts to cross rivers. However, the armor's strength came with a vulnerability to fire. In the humid southern climate, fire was not a major concern—until Zhuge Liang devised a resourceful strategy. He lured the Nanman soldiers into a valley and set a fire trap, engulfing them in flames. This was the final step in pacifying the south, though Zhuge Liang regretted the necessity of such a destructive tactic. The reason this armor was so durable is that it took two years to craft a set. Vines were soaked in oil and dried repeatedly over time. Recent tests in Beijing comparing rattan armor with cotton armor and chain mail revealed that rattan armor surprisingly outperformed both competitors."

    ],
    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Guo Jia: This armor is perfect for Guo Jia. Every time he is attacked, he performs a judgment and adds the card to his hand. Not only does he have a chance of getting a free Escape, but sometimes the judgment card is even a Peach. Even if the judgment fails, he still gains a card.",
      "Zhang Jiao: Zhang Jiao becomes a terrifying presence when equipped with the Eight Trigrams. The rest of the table will think twice before attacking him because now he can trigger \"Lightning Strike\" without using his own Escapes. This allows him to save his spades for more \"Lightning Strikes\".",
      "Judgment Manipulators: Characters who can influence judgments enjoy this armor’s presence. They can either protect their teammates or sabotage their enemies. When playing against these characters, it might be wise to forgo the judgment, as it could backfire. Key manipulators include Sima Yi, Zhang Jiao, Zhuge Liang, and Jiang Wei.",
      "Wang Yi: When Wang Yi equips this armor, she becomes nearly untouchable. Her ability to retry judgments increases her chances of avoiding an attack significantly.",
      "Xiao Qiao: Xiao Qiao becomes particularly hard to hit with this armor. Since all of her spades are considered hearts, she has around three-quarters of the deck available for red judgments.",
      "Unblockable Attackers: Characters with unblockable attacks can bypass the Eight Trigrams armor, as the armor only generates an Escape card, which cannot stop these attacks. Notable characters include Ma Chao and Huang Zhong.",
      "Lu Bu: When Lu Bu attacks a player with Eight Trigrams, he forces them to perform two judgments, but they do them one at a time. If the first judgment fails, they must use their own Escape before trying the second judgment. Players often let the first hit land to avoid discarding too many cards.",
      "Pang De: Pang De can quickly neutralize the Eight Trigrams. If the target successfully uses the armor’s judgment or plays an Escape, Pang De can discard any card they own, usually targeting the armor itself. This reduces the armor's effectiveness to that of a single Escape.",
      "Cao Cao and Wei Generals: When Cao Cao is the ruler, and a member of Wei has the Eight Trigrams equipped, they can perform a judgment to provide Cao Cao with an Escape. If the judgment fails, they do not have to use an Escape from their hand.",
      "Fire Zhuge Liang: Zhuge Liang has this armor by default, so equipping it offers no additional benefit.",
      "Yu Jin: Yu Jin has his own built-in defensive ability, \"Heavy Resolve,\" which usually outweighs the benefits of equipping the Eight Trigrams. However, there are exceptions, such as when facing a character like Guan Yu, where the Eight Trigrams might offer better protection."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "The Eight Trigrams armor is a valuable asset, offering significant protection against attacks. However, your opponents are well aware of its benefits and will likely target you to remove it as soon as possible. While it offers a chance to avoid attacks, remember that it relies on luck. There will be times when the judgment fails repeatedly, leaving you vulnerable. Although this armor can greatly extend your survivability, it makes no guarantees. Use it wisely, but don't over-rely on it."
    ],
    "RelationToHistory": [
      "The Eight Trigrams armor is based on a formation used by ancient soldiers. This formation was effective for those skilled in its use. One of the earliest references to the formation comes from when Xu Shu guided Zhao Yun through Cao Ren's array, shattering the formation. Later, both Zhuge Liang and Jiang Wei used a version of the Eight Trigrams formation during their northern expeditions. The most famous use of the formation is when Zhuge Liang created the Stone Sentinel Maze, which nearly trapped Lu Xun as it protected the retreating Liu Bei. Legend says that the stones still stand today, submerged in the waters of the Yangtze during the summer months."

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "The Gender Swords are highly effective when targeting characters of the opposite gender, but they have limited use otherwise. Their strength lies in consistent attacks over multiple turns, gradually depleting the opponent's hand while giving the attacker more cards. However, as the weapon becomes more effective, opponents will become more eager to destroy or steal it, so be sure to protect it well."

    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Attack Creators: Characters that can generate Attack cards excel with the Green Dragon Blade. They can repeatedly force their target to use Escapes, exhausting their defenses and setting up for an ally’s finishing blow. Examples: Guan Yu, Zhao Yun.",
      "Large Hands: Characters with large hands full of expendable Attack cards benefit from this weapon, as it guarantees that one of their attacks will eventually hit. Examples: Lu Meng, Zhen Ji, Yuan Shu, Huang Gai, God Cao Cao.",
      "Zhang Jiao: Zhang Jiao uses this weapon differently. When he plays an Escape, he triggers \"Lightning Strike\", and the attacker can try again. If Zhang Jiao escapes again, \"Lightning Strike\" reactivates. This continues until either the attacker stops or Zhang Jiao gets hit.",

Unlike the Crossbow, this weapon is often used more strategically, weakening opponents' defenses to create opportunities for others to strike."

The blade became a symbol of Guan Yu’s might, and after his death, it was passed down to his son Guan Xing, who continued to use it in Zhuge Liang’s northern campaigns against Wei. The Green Dragon Blade remains a lasting symbol of loyalty and strength, much like its original owner."

      "The Longbow is a versatile weapon with a wide reach and a useful ability that costs nothing to activate. It allows you to damage your target while also discarding their horses, making it easier for others to engage them. The downside is that you must hit the target to discard their horse, and they must actually have a horse for this effect to work.

His third shot, however, struck Guan Yu’s helmet, showcasing his precision.

The horse was completely red, without a single differently colored hair. Initially owned by the infamous Dong Zhuo, Red Hare was used to bribe Lu Bu into betraying and killing his foster father, Ding Yuan, and joining Dong Zhuo's side. With the two legends—Lu Bu and Red Hare—united, their enemies trembled in fear. The pair faced many challenges together, including notable battles at Hu Lao Gate and Xia Pi. Lu Bu remained in possession of Red Hare until his death at the hands of Cao Cao.",

Guan Yu remained with Red Hare until his eventual defeat at the hands of Lu Meng and Sun Quan. After Guan Yu’s execution, Sun Quan gave the horse to his general Ma Zhong. However, Red Hare refused to be ridden or to eat, ultimately dying of starvation, mourning the loss of its master."

The weapon was with Lu Bu during his legendary battle at Hu Lao Gate, where he fought Zhang Fei, Guan Yu, and Liu Bei simultaneously. After Dong Zhuo's death, Lu Bu carried the Sky Scorcher with him to Xu Zhou and Xia Pi. Famously, Lu Bu used it to shoot an arrow and broker peace between Liu Bei and Yuan Shu. However, Lu Bu's confidence in his abilities with the Sky Scorcher led to his downfall. As Cao Cao besieged him, Lu Bu neglected his soldiers, and they eventually tied him up in his sleep and surrendered. To prove their loyalty, they threw the Sky Scorcher over the city wall to Cao Cao.

For example, Yuan Shao can force multiple players within range to play Escape, increasing the weapon's chances of triggering. The more players forced to defend, the more likely the weapon can attack and cause damage.",
      "Target-Forced Escapes:Characters like Zhang Fei or Gao Shun, who can attack multiple players often, create opportunities for their targets to play Escapes. Since these characters naturally create scenarios where Escape cards are used, they synergize well with the Seven Star Sword.",

    "FinalRemarks": [
      "The Seven Star Sword offers a dynamic and high-risk, high-reward mechanic. Its ability to disrupt opponents by forcing them to either lose life or take the weapon creates strategic depth, especially when paired with effects that increase the frequency of attacks or Escape plays. However, its reliance on opponents being within range and using Escape limits its flexibility, making it less effective in scenarios where these conditions are not met. Players who use Seven Star Sword should be prepared to lose the weapon at some point and plan accordingly to regain or replace it."

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "The Seven Star Sword plays a pivotal role in one of the most famous attempts to end Dong Zhuo’s tyrannical reign during the late Han Dynasty. This weapon is the centerpiece of a gripping tale of loyalty, betrayal, and failed assassination.",
      "Wang Yun, a minister loyal to the Han dynasty, was desperate to rid the court of Dong Zhuo's oppressive control. During a gathering of officials, Wang Yun feigned hosting a birthday celebration to mask his true intent. Cao Cao who boldly stepped forward with a plan. Cao Cao declared he would assassinate Dong Zhuo himself, requesting a suitable weapon for the task.",
      "Wang Yun entrusted Cao Cao with the Seven Star Sword, a magnificent blade adorned with inlaid jewels, symbolizing the weight of this dangerous mission. Armed with the weapon, Cao Cao approached Dong Zhuo’s palace, feigning allegiance while concealing his intent. He found Dong Zhuo reclining on a couch and prepared to strike. However, Dong Zhuo spotted Cao Cao’s reflection in a mirror and questioned his actions. Thinking quickly, Cao Cao presented the sword as a \"gift,\" masking his intentions. The moment passed, and Cao Cao, unable to execute the plan, fled the palace under the pretext of testing a horse.",
      "The sword’s intended role as an instrument of justice was thwarted, but it became a symbol of the tension and intrigue that defined the era. Dong Zhuo later grew suspicious of Cao Cao and ordered a manhunt.",
      "In Sanguosha, the Seven Star Sword reflects this dramatic historical moment through its game mechanics. The card allows its wielder to discard an extra card from their target, symbolizing the treachery and calculated risks involved in Cao Cao’s mission. The ability to \"shed blood\" by inflicting greater harm represents the deadly intent of the blade, while the added tactical depth mirrors the careful plotting needed for success in the high-stakes environment of court politics. The Seven Star Sword bridges the tension of its historical significance with its function in the game, providing players with a versatile tool to dominate their opponents while evoking the perilous nature of assassination plots in the Three Kingdoms era."

During a campaign against Shu, Gan Ning, despite being ill, mounted his horse to face the enemy but encountered Shamoke’s elite forces.",
      "Shamoke was armed with a spiked iron mace adorned with bone pendants, a weapon that symbolized his savage and deadly nature. Leading his barefoot warriors with ferocious precision, Shamoke’s overwhelming presence caused Gan Ning to retreat, recognizing he had no chance against such an opponent. However, as Gan Ning fled, Shamoke shot an arrow that fatally struck him. Gan Ning managed to reach Fuchikou before succumbing to his wound, where crows gathered around his corpse in an eerie display, as if mourning his death.",

    "Clarifications": [
      "Black Attacks cannot be evaded when the Black Shield is equipped. They are automatically blocked without needing to play an Escape.",
      "Colorless Attacks ignore the Black Shield and hit as normal.",
      "Effects that occur before the Attack makes contact still happen. For instance, the Gender Swords can still trigger their ability, but after that, a black Attack is nullified.",
      "If the player with the Black Shield is in Chains, they can be hit by an indirect black Attack. However, they cannot be the first person in the Chains to receive damage."

    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Sun Ce: Sun Ce greatly benefits from the Black Shield. It forces opponents to use red Attacks against him, which triggers \"Passion\" more frequently, giving him extra cards and making him stronger.",
      "Red Attack Users: Characters that can easily generate red Attacks are not hindered by the Black Shield. They simply switch their strategy to attacking with red cards. Key characters include Guan Yu, Zhao Yun, Guan Xing & Zhang Bao, and Xiao Qiao.",
      "Colorless Attack Users: Generals who can produce colorless Attacks bypass the Black Shield entirely. While these Attacks are rare, they can shift the battle’s momentum. Notable characters include Xiahou Yuan and Chen Gong.",
      "Unblockable Attackers: Characters with unblockable Attacks, like Ma Chao and Huang Zhong, are countered by the Black Shield. Since the shield blocks the entire Attack, the defender doesn’t even need to play an Escape.",
      "Yu Ji: When Yu Ji attacks someone with the Black Shield, the color of the card he uses becomes the color of the Attack. If other players believe him, Yu Ji can bypass the shield using psychological tricks.",
      "Yu Jin: Yu Jin’s ability provides a stronger form of protection than the Black Shield, so equipping it would actually weaken his defenses."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "The Black Shield is incredibly valuable because it blocks most Attacks, as black cards are more common than red. However, the downside is its vulnerability to red Attacks. If the opposing team has characters who can exploit this weakness, the shield becomes less effective. Additionally, having the Black Shield can attract attention, leading to opponents targeting or discarding it. Despite these risks, keeping the Black Shield in play offers solid defense against most threats."

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "While there is no direct reference to the Black Shield in the historical stories, it’s possible that the barbarian tribes of the south, the Nanman, used similar materials for their armor and shields. These shields were effective against conventional weapons like swords and arrows, forcing Zhuge Liang to employ alternative tactics during his campaign to pacify the southern tribes."

    "Description": "When an attack hits its target, the player with the weapon has a choice. They can either damage the target or chose to remove two cards from the target.",
    "Slug": "ice-sword",
    "Clarifications": [
      "The attacker decides whether to deal damage or force the target to discard cards after the target does not use an Escape.",
      "If Wine is used with the Ice Sword, the effect is all or nothing: either the attack deals two damage, or the target discards two cards.",
      "Cards are discarded one by one. If the target has only one card, they lose it; if they have more than one, they must discard two cards. If the target has no hand cards, they are forced to take the damage.",
      "Both equipment and hand cards can be discarded. Pending cards (delayed tools in progress) cannot be discarded."
    ],
    "NotableCombinations": [
      "Guaranteed Hit Characters: Characters like Ma Chao and Huang Zhong who have abilities that guarantee a hit can maximize the Ice Sword’s utility by forcing opponents to discard cards, even if the target has an Escape. This is especially useful for removing troublesome equipment.",
      "Hua Tuo: Hua Tuo needs to be cautious with the Ice Sword. Normally, he only loses a single card when healing back damage. However, with the Ice Sword, he could lose two cards instead of just one, making it much harder for him to recover after being worn down.",
      "Xiao Qiao: Xiao Qiao is particularly vulnerable to the Ice Sword. If she doesn’t use an Escape and the attacker opts to discard her cards instead of dealing damage, she cannot activate her ability, leaving her defenseless and out of two cards."
    ],
    "FinalRemarks": [
      "The Ice Sword is a tactical weapon, best used for a few key turns to weaken an opponent. It excels at stripping away a target’s equipment piece by piece, especially armor and defenses. Once their defenses are down, the attacker can deal direct damage. However, the Ice Sword's usefulness fades in prolonged engagements—while you can continuously discard your opponent's cards, they'll eventually draw more, and you're not dealing any lasting damage. That said, it still has value, as you always retain the option to simply inflict damage when needed."

    "RelationToHistory": [
      "The Ice Sword is a fictional creation for this game and has no basis in historical events or the novel."
